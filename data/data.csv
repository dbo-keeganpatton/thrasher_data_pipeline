0,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","Hey, Aaron, how’s it going?", I can’t complain; just chillin’ with my girlfriend in New York at the moment.
1,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Can you walk right now?," Yeah, I can walk. I actually got the okay to start skating already at four months out from surgery. I’ve been beasting on the PT. I go to the gym all the time and go to PT twice a week. I’m walkin’ a lot and trying to stay active."
2,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",That’s great to hear. Let’s go back. How did you injure your knee?," I was skating with Jon Colyer and Joe Brook a lot, going back and forth to Portland to work on this interview. Jon and Joe were both going to leave on trips, but I really wanted to get one more clip and photo to finish it off. The deadline we put on ourselves was coming up and I needed to get back to New York. I remember thinking, "
3,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Were you freaking out?," I’m prescribed anxiety medication for some mental-health stuff. I started feeling a little panic coming on, so I’m like, "
4,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","First off, I just almost threw up. Second off, was this your first big injury to your knee?"," So on that one, I tore my ACL, meniscus and my MCL. I’d had other issues before from hyperflexing my knee. That was about six months before the recent one. But the first time I had adrenaline going and was still able to get the clip. It felt shitty afterwards and those results said a similar thing. It was like, "
5,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","Goddamn. This seems to be a uniquely American pro-skater problem. Like if a pro baseball player feels even a slight pinch, they see a string of specialists that go into every diagnostic possible and give them the best PT around. You just have to get the bare minimum and tough it up or walk it out. Seems like we should have the same health standards."," Yeah, with the things that I know now at 34, if I would have been as disciplined when I was 25, God only knows if I would have even had this injury. I’ve learned now that certain muscles and parts of your body, your hips, your pelvic area, your tibialis muscles—which are at the front of your shins—and all these other things all correspond within your body. If one thing is out of whack, then you’re gonna overcompensate for the other. Essentially, that’s what I did for months without realizing it. After my MCL tear, it would hurt; it would pinch a lot. And then all in that day it just gave way. I try to look at people who ride bikes or run or play soccer—not even professionally—they seem to take their body more seriously than most skateboarders do. They train, buy the bibs, the whole kit and it’s just their hobby. Even when skateboarding is your job, we don’t take the same appreciation and care for our bodies."
6,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","Yeah. It’s a hard balance, because you’re not just trying to do tricks, but you’re also selling a look and attitude about street life. If you bomb a hill and you look like you have a diaper full of hip pads, you’re gonna look insane. So you have to also consider the fashionable standards of the moment as well."," As difficult as it is, you can’t go 100-percent into something; you still have to keep the identity you have within skateboarding."
7,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",You can’t go full jock.," Yeah, but I see Stevie Williams on Instagram; he’s in his 40s and he’s fucking jacked. Or I watched this Felipe Gustavo documentary about the rehab stuff he does, and he’s one of the best skaters on the planet. Listening to him talk about training and all these other things, he doesn’t make it his personality or character, but he takes it so seriously and I was like, "
8,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",So you put in the work. You had surgery in June and you’re already cleared to start skating. How is that possible?," Well, I haven’t started skating yet, because I don’t feel confident yet and I don’t want to get overzealous. I’ve been extremely regimented with what my physical therapy has to be. In the past, I broke my ankle and I didn’t do my PT. I realized like, "
9,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",How have you maintained your mental health and your relationship with substances as you’ve had your main outlet taken away?," To be completely transparent, I’ve never stopped smoking weed. So as far as my sobriety, I try to be careful with using that word, because it’s very precious for some people. I just haven’t drank for what’s coming on six years now. I made the choice to stop drinking alcohol because of the issues I was having with my mental health. At the time, alcohol was just exasperating those things. Truth is, I’m getting older. I’m 34; I’ll be 35 by the time I’m able to skate again. So honestly, the biggest thing that upset me the most was my age when the injury happened. I had my surgery on my birthday—"
10,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",What’s your game?, I’m a 
11,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Do you watch a lot of skating in your downtime? Do you keep up with the sites?," Yeah, I have my YouTube subscriptions that I follow and things like that. This probably goes for a lot of people, but I try to watch the things that have my friends in it. At the same time I could watch Ish Cepeda skate or Robert Neal and I’m like, "
12,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Is that because you’re looking for inspiration on big terrain?," Snowboarding is relatable because it’s a board sport, but it’s so OD. They’re like switch 270 backlipping 20-flat-20 handrails. You can’t "
13,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","Yeah, they can hit things or build ramps to things that materialize fantasy in ways we can’t."," And there’s different aspects to street-level snowboarding, which I never knew. There are some dudes that use a winch, and maybe aren’t as respected as if you do it with natural speed."
14,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Is it funny to see the cultural norms reflected? Using a bungee for a us is a little passé.," Oh yeah, there’s only certain dudes that maybe get a pass using a bungee in skating."
15,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",I’ll give Sheckler a pass., That’s who I was referring to.
16,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","On that note, are boardslide yank-outs over? Are you still going to continue that fight?"," I read Cyrus’ Five Greats and he put them under tricks he’ll never do. Because I respect Cyrus’ skating so much, I was like "
17,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",You’re one of the great rail skaters of our time. Do you feel like rail skating has kind of gotten less interesting as it’s gotten more figured out?," Oh, the crosslock? People used to grind rails on your toe edge or heel edge and there wasn’t a whole lot of that crosslock. It was sketchy. But take "
18,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","Yeah, you gotta show that you might not have it figured out.", I think a good example of that is Jim Greco. In those 
19,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",not, I think a good example of that is Jim Greco. In those 
20,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","He’s had an honorable career. You’ve made your name as a video-part skater. Crafting these things slowly and intentionally is becoming more untenable. Do you look back at Static and the Polar videos as the more honorable discipline, or do you feel like it’s actually good to let things kind of be more temporal and less precious?", I’ll always view 
21,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Static, I’ll always view 
22,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","And you’ve got a new video part coming out in Paul Young’s Down By Law, which had an ad in the mag!", Yeah. I filmed most of 
23,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Down By Law, Yeah. I filmed most of 
24,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","So that’s an East Coast part, but you also have an all-Portland part. How important was it to make something all in your home state?"," I’ve actually thought about it for probably ten years. After years being dishonest with myself about filming a part, I just thought, "
25,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Set the record straight. Who’s got the crustier spots: Portland or New York?," Portland, for sure. We don’t have marble in the same way in the Northwest. The weathering is so much worse. In New York, you can Bondo a spot and it might be good. Oregon, you gotta Bondo, lacquer, rub brick and blowtorch the ground to make it dry. It’s like four steps."
26,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",What’s the best place you’ve been to skate?," I’d say Tel Aviv, but that’s gonna be controversial. Besides the unfortunate circumstances of the country and surrounding areas, it was a very fun place to skate. Greece was a really cool place to skate. Athens and Thessaloniki were really cool. And then probably Malmö, Sweden where Pontus and Polar are from. It’s cool to see all Pontus’ spots just biking around."
27,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",How has it been to see Polar go from a start-up skate company to the most important pants brand in the world?," It’s been pretty insane. Many of us on the team have been a part of it for over ten years, which sounds crazy to say. It felt cool as an American joining a European board company to make it an international company. I’m not saying it was the first, but then seeing other international brands come up like Palace, Magenta, Pass~Port, Evisen and others is cool. Seeing the growth of Polar has been awesome. It’s been an honor. Seeing Pontus’ progression in the quality of products, the type of graphics and the board shapes is really cool. We’ve been able to have our hands in certain projects; there’s board graphics that we get to have a good say on and board shapes, too. I don’t know if everyone gets to have that."
28,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Toward the end of your career would you rather milk it and fizzle or go out on top like Kirchart?," As the great Chet Thomas once said, “I’d like to skate until I can’t walk.” I would like to skate until I’m 45 like Joey Pepper. If it gets to a point where reality sets in and being an 18-year-old 35 year old has to stop, I have no qualms with getting a job or going into a trade. I talk about HVAC all the time. I’ve had an awesome life and awesome opportunities. If I have to make my living like most Americans, it’s like, "
29,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","If someone is intimidated and wants to talk to you on a session, what should they do?"," Just come up and say something dorky. I’m just as timid or shy as anybody else, but I’m very approachable. I’m always gonna communicate with someone who reaches out. I’d love to believe I’m on the furthest end of the spectrum of what we negatively view as a cool guy. I’ve had people reach out on Instagram that have asked about mental health or not drinking and I’ve made friends with some people for years now. Some people have showed me their Polar board and I’m like, "
30,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",What happens when we die?," Fuck, I don’t know."
31,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","It’s kind of weird that if there are ghosts, there’s not that many of them. It seems like we just go away, right?"," You know, I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about that. I’m trying to live today, and if I’m worried about what’s happening after I die, I feel like I’m missing something today. I will get philosophical for a second: Let’s say heaven and hell—I think heaven and hell is a metaphor for the mindsets in which we live. It’s not an afterlife experience, it’s a living experience and you create your heaven or you create your hell. You can follow every doom-scrolling thing you see on social media and every clickbait thing online and live miserably, or you can slow it down and just be like, "

51,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Sky Brown's ""Gassed Up"" Interview</h3>",I heard you moved from your last place ’cause people found out where you lived and they were leaving weird stuff on your doorstep.,"Yeah, I was living in Oceanside. I was always walking around there and people figured out where I lived and left some stuff on my front door. It was really sweet, like letters and stuff, but it just got kinda creepy. So yeah, we moved to a pretty secret spot."
52,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Sky Brown's ""Gassed Up"" Interview</h3>",That’s good. Keep it secret. What’s the biggest freak out you’ve ever witnessed in person?,"There were a few fans that were tearing up and it felt really good, I guess, just seeing how happy they were to see me and it made me wanna do even more to inspire them. So yeah, there’s definitely been some really cool people I got to meet."
53,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Sky Brown's ""Gassed Up"" Interview</h3>",That’s cool. I had someone freak out on me before. You wanna hear the story?,Yeah.
54,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Sky Brown's ""Gassed Up"" Interview</h3>",I had someone recognize me when I was going into a truck-stop bathroom and then they followed me in there and I had to take a number two.

I haven’t had that one yet. Maybe one day…
55,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Sky Brown's ""Gassed Up"" Interview</h3>","Yeah, you gotta watch out. The rule is you gotta travel in a pack. You can’t get caught slipping solo out there.

Do you think that I could negatively affect your Olympic plans if we keep skating together?","Yeah, Mike, I don’t know—I think you’re making me a little bit crazy with this stuff. But it’s fine. A little bit of ice cream definitely makes my day."
58,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Sky Brown's ""Gassed Up"" Interview</h3>","Ice cream makes my day, too—as long as we don’t do it every day.","Yeah. Well, actually my mom’s a nutritionist so we’re pretty healthy at home, but when I go out and my mom’s not there sometimes I get a little sneaky."

102,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",What was your reaction when you saw your Thrasher cover?, I think it was like four or five in the morning and I seen my phone kind of blowing up. Then when I read it I kind of exploded out of bed and just started running around a little bit. I went to my outdoor refrigerator and got myself a beer and drunk a beer at four in the morning. Then I woke up my dad and made him drink a beer with me at four in the morning.

What’s going on?," I think the last couple of years me and my filmer out here have just been putting all these little projects together. Nothing really for any brands, we’ve just sort of been doing our own thing. And then unexpectedly I had a couple parts come out during one year and then getting the Australian Skater of the Year was massive. I feel like all the momentum kinda came off the back end of all of that."
106,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",, 
107,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Yeah, the ASOTY."," I was going between board sponsors and trying to figure all of that stuff out—I went on a three-month US trip to do that and meet a couple of people. The Santa Cruz thing happened and then getting invited on all those trips, it all just kept flowing and kept going. It was great. "
108,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Yeah, how did you know that Santa Cruz was the right choice for you?"," Well, I think it’s great that they also have a really good understanding with the international people. They have really good support with all of that. I mean, the team’s great. When I met Pizzle and Andrew Cannon it all seemed really good. When we spoke about everything, they just seemed like they were really interested and they had a little opportunity for me so it felt like the right choice."
109,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Yeah, and then you’ve been going crazy ever since. You’ve been on all kinds of trips, right? What was your summer like?"," Yeah. Well, I went on the Am Scramble and then I went straight on the "
110,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",So were you ready to jump on the Scramble or did you have any reservations?," No, I mean, not really. I was ready, man. When I got that call and they told me about that I was fucking hyped. I was too scared to even skate at home. I was like, "
111,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","I’m just gonna wait it out, fly over and skate when I’m there", 
112,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",Who did you know on that trip before you went on it?," I knew Patrick and Kieran and that was it. I’d met Patrick previously on trips that I’d been on, so I was pretty stoked to see him there, too. That was cool. I got to see him again—I hadn’t seen him for like three or four years so it was super good to catch up with him on that trip. "
113,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Rad. Yeah, we had people from all over and all different styles of skating. We had these pure street skaters like Nick Matthews, we had little Noah and Max trying to drag pole jams everywhere. What was it like to skate watching all these different approaches?"," Oh, I loved it. That was probably the coolest part about the whole trip was seeing everyone skate so differently and to see other people’s minds work differently and see spots in different ways. So it was super sick."
114,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",It seems like you and Kieran—it was rare that you didn’t at least try something at the spot. Is that the Australia way? ," I’m not really too sure. I think I’ve always sort of done it to myself, like if I go on a trip I try to skate every one of the spots. Even if it’s something that I can’t really skate, it’s like I kinda like the challenge of just trying to do something even if it’s something that’s not so great—just trying to do as much as I can, I guess. And I guess Kieran has kind of the same mindset, too. He skates ramps and he’s at the top of hubbas being like, "
115,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Hey, man, how do I do this?", 
116,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Dude, just go for it and you’ll do it straight away", 
117,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Yep, that’s the way you do it", 
118,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Yeah, he seemed like he was definitely figuring it out as he went, right?"," Yeah, ’cause he was like, "
119,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Yeah, I didn’t really feel like we needed to take him to the bowl at all."," No, that was so sick to see that. I was really stoked for him for that. "
120,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",Who are some of the people or tricks that really surprised you on the trip?," Nick Matthews’ skating is incredible to watch. A bunch of the stuff he did on the trip was super impressive skateboarding. It just seems really powerful as well, when you watch it. "
121,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","What was your favorite trick that you got? You got a lot of tricks—you ollied into the triple-set hubba, you did the crazy snake grind. What was your favorite move that you were most satisfied with?"," God, that’s a hard one. I think probably the snake grind 50-50 just because that rail was so unique and it felt like the coolest thing to do. Those curves were so aggressive, it was super fun. When I locked in and went around it, it felt super rewarding. "
122,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",I didn’t think it was possible.," Yeah, I was hyped on that one, that’s for sure. "
123,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",What about the ollie into the hubba? I don’t know if you heard this but the last person who tried it in the ’90s broke their back.," I actually forgot about the hubba. Yeah, that thing was scary. Holy shit, that was super scary. On one of the falls I slid down on my knee and I was just looking over the edge like, "
124,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",Oh my gosh, 
125,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Oh, man, I’m so glad you didn’t tell me this before I tried it", 
126,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Dude, yeah, it’s better off not knowing some of that stuff.", Absolutely.
127,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",What’s your actual town that you’re in?," The place that I live is called Tumbi Umbi. That’s the town I live in but the area would be the Central Coast. I definitely wouldn’t say it has a large amount of skateboarding here. As a kid growing up and going skating with my friends, I would get on the train and go to Central Sydney which is about an hour and half away, so I’ve been doing that trip for many, many years. "
128,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","I was gonna say, with the mustache and the mullet and the heavy machinery, are you kind of an Australian redneck?"," Oh, man, I’m definitely not a true one, that’s for sure. There’s some heavier rednecks and mullet dudes out here that are insane. "
129,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Yeah, what are rednecks called in Central Coast Australia?", Bogans. 
130,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Bogans, mate."," Yeah, there’s a few of them around, that’s for sure. Especially working in the industry that I work in, you see them everywhere."
131,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",They’re attracted to the power tools.," Yup, we call them tradies. You see a lot of Bogans in the tradies. "
132,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","So the Scramble has become a springboard for a lot of guys to go pro. It sounds like you’ve got a good solid career at home, but is being a pro skater something you’ve ever considered?"," Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I guess it’s the ultimate goal for myself. If it ever happens that will be the pinnacle for me, I feel like. "
133,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",When will you know it’s time?," I’m not sure—I’m not sure if I get to make that call. I’ll just keep skating, doing what I’m doing and if that happens then I’m stoked—if not, whatever. Just keep skating."
134,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",So tell us about your status here in the United States. You live with your girlfriend at a house with a ramp out in the country. How did you get into this fantastic situation? Where’d you even meet this girl?," I met her at the contest that led up to the Olympics in Iowa, actually. She was out supporting one of her friends and I actually had a little COVID scare. I couldn’t skate, but I didn’t have COVID so I went out to a party and met her. I was stoked."
135,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","Yeah, you’re living the American dream out there and you’re not even American.", Pretty much.
136,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","Having a vert ramp at your house, have you stepped up your vert game at all?"," I’ve been trying to skate it a fair bit. I don’t really like it too much but it’s fun to mess around on. We’ve been having good sessions with Navarrette and Hewitt and a bunch of those legends have been coming out and skating, so it’s been sick for them to push me."
137,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",Fuck yeah. So give us some basic stats—where are you from and how old are you?," I am from Minnamurra, New South Wales and I am 18 years old."
138,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",So how does the Scramble compare to getting ready for the Olympics? Is it harder? Is it a vacation compared to that?," It’s way better—you’re just out there skating with your friends, having a good time. I mean, not that preparing for the Olympics wasn’t that, it’s just two different mindsets."
139,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",I spoke to Nyjah about this—were you scared to street skate and skate normally leading up to the Olympics?," Yeah, I didn’t really head out and film too much in that time because I was like, "
140,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",If I get hurt then that’s not gonna be good, 
141,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","I was wondering if we were gonna have to find bowls for you to get clips, but y"," I mean, I try to skate everything. That was my goal on the trip—to just jump on all the rails and ledges and just have fun and skate with everybody, push with everybody and if there’s a bowl I’ll skate it. If not, it’s all good."
142,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","ou skated every single street spot. Is that a misconception, that you’re just a bowl guy?"," I mean, I try to skate everything. That was my goal on the trip—to just jump on all the rails and ledges and just have fun and skate with everybody, push with everybody and if there’s a bowl I’ll skate it. If not, it’s all good."
143,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","So yeah, you didn’t bring your pads on the trip, huh?"," Nah, nah. No pads—ever."
144,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",What kind of name is Woolley? Do you know your family name history?, I’ve got no clue. I think like British or something? I honestly have no clue.
145,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","Your dad’s aggro, too, right? I met him. He’s pretty young and he’s into fun stuff."," Yeah, he likes to ride motorbikes, surf, skate. He broke his neck surfing when I was a little grom. He likes to do it all."
146,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","Did he skate with you, too?"," Yeah, so me and my dad started skating at the same time, actually. My dad learned handplants before me. We built a little mini-ramp in the backyard and we were just messing around all the time in between surfs and going motorbike riding and just living life."
147,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","Oh, man, sounds like paradise out there."," Yep, it’s the best."
148,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","So I gotta ask you—how’d you end up on this board company with the world’s greatest woman skaters? They’re like, We want THAT guy?"," Yeah, it was pretty random. I think I met Sky when I was a little grom in Australia. She came out to Bowl-a-Rama and my dad and her dad Stu hit it off. So my dad and Stu kept a really close relationship for a while and I know Leticia just through contests. And yeah, when they were starting their board company they reached out to me to see if I’d be down to ride for them and I was like, "
149,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",We want THAT guy," Yeah, it was pretty random. I think I met Sky when I was a little grom in Australia. She came out to Bowl-a-Rama and my dad and her dad Stu hit it off. So my dad and Stu kept a really close relationship for a while and I know Leticia just through contests. And yeah, when they were starting their board company they reached out to me to see if I’d be down to ride for them and I was like, "
150,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","Yeah, some people are tough guys. They’ll be like, Ah, I don’t want to be on a girls’ team. Did you have any second thoughts like that?"," Definitely at the start, but I talked to Stu and I talked to everybody running it and I realized that it’s not a girls’ company. Like, of course Leticia and Sky started it, but most of the riders are dudes and it’s just sick to get out. Like, we go on trips all the time, head out and film and skate and it’s just a good time."
151,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","Ah, I don’t want to be on a girls’ team"," Definitely at the start, but I talked to Stu and I talked to everybody running it and I realized that it’s not a girls’ company. Like, of course Leticia and Sky started it, but most of the riders are dudes and it’s just sick to get out. Like, we go on trips all the time, head out and film and skate and it’s just a good time."
152,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","Yeah. I noticed you and Rob, you tried something on every single spot. Is that an Australian thing or were you just so hyped to be out there?"," Pretty much we were just so hyped to be out there. Me and Rob, at the start of the trip, ’cause we were rooming together, we were like, "
153,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","You know what? We’re skating everything. We don’t care if it’s a ledge, we don’t care if it’s whatever, we’re just gonna skate", 
154,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","Shit, we’re so sore; we might need to chill out a bit", 
155,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",Who was somebody on the trip that you hadn’t met before that you were hyped once you got to skate with them?," Dude, pretty much everybody. Patrick Praman, like, I’ve seen footage of him forever and he was just mind blowing what he could do on a rail—flip in, flip out, it was just so sick. As well as Nick Matthews—dude’s got so much pop and you get to a spot and he’s sitting down and then all of a sudden just—bam—the gnarliest thing you’ve ever seen."
156,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",That dude can ollie the house., For real.
157,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",What about Max? He’s really funny and really fun to hang out with but then he gets gnarly in his own weird ways.," Oh yeah, Max, he’s a legend. I had so much fun skating with him. He’s just like chilling there, talking shit, acting all goofy and then he’ll skate off and build some insane rail or some sketchy contraption and it’s just so sick whatever he does whenever he steps on a board."
158,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",Fuck yeah. What about Dylan? Did you know him from Instagram?," Yeah, I knew Dylan. I skated with him a few times around San Diego, but I’d never really gotten to hang out with him or go on a trip with him, so that was super sick to get to know him a bit better. He’s so talented. I wish I could skate a ledge like that but that ain’t happening."
159,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","You’ll give it your best shot, though, right?"," I’ll give it my best shot. I might throw a switch crook or something. No flip tricks, though."
160,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",What’s a basic flip trick that you just absolutely cannot do?, Heelflips.
161,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",No heelflips?," I can do ’em but, dude, they’re rough."
162,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",What was your favorite trick that you saw on the trip?," My favorite trick that I saw on the trip was either Max’s pole-jam 50-50, Rob’s ollie into the death bank or I reckon Dylan’s frontside flip was ridiculous. That big frontside flip was next level. And then also—fuck, I can’t even remember what went down, so much stuff. I think Nick’s ollie over the rail into the sketchy bank, that was really sick."
163,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",Who do you think’s gonna get a board first?, That’s a good question. I reckon Rob. Santa Cruz is pushing him pretty hard right now. I heard they got something coming real soon.
164,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","Oh, that’d be tight. Had you skated with him much at home?"," I skated with him a bit, but it’s usually whenever I go up to the Central Coast I’ll skate with him at the local park—Bateau Bay. I never really headed out filming in the streets, but I’m going back for Christmas and New Year’s and I’m gonna be skating with him like the whole time. I’m so keen."
165,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",So the Scramble is often a jumping off point for turning pro. Are you ready? Do," I think I want to turn pro, for sure. I’m filming a part right now. I’m gonna put that part out and then I’ve got a few other little things I’m working on and then maybe after that’s all done see how it’s looking."
166,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>", you want to turn pro?," I think I want to turn pro, for sure. I’m filming a part right now. I’m gonna put that part out and then I’ve got a few other little things I’m working on and then maybe after that’s all done see how it’s looking."
167,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","So yeah, what do you want to accomplish before you feel good about having your name on a board?"," I really just wanna solidify myself more as a street skater and kinda trying to just achieve ATV status. So that’s what I’m working on with this new part. I’ve also got a bunch of footage coming out for OJ, and then I’m going to Europe for a month for a Monster premiere next week and I’ve got a few clips in that. So just trying to put out as much footage as I can and, yeah, just skate and have fun."
168,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",What’s the secret to McTwists?, I can’t do ‘em. You’re asking the wrong person.
169,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",What’s your favorite trick that you got on the trip?, I really liked when I carved around and ollied over the weird thing into the skinny bank. I was stoked on that.
170,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",That was sketchy. ," Yeah, I was pretty stoked with that and then some transition follow lines that Rye filmed in that one bowl. Those turned out so good."
171,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","Yeah, he’s good."," Yeah, he killed it."
172,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","We ate some pretty horrible food on this trip. If it’s a choice between Applebee’s and Mackers, which do you choose?", Applebee’s wasn’t too bad. But you cannot beat Mackers. That is just hands down.
173,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>",So funny—we’d be talking shit about Mackers and then next thing you know people one by one would be going there to get some., Mmm…
174,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","Ten years from now, what’s gonna be your main memory from the Am Scramble 2022?", I think my favorite memory will probably be when Max landed that trick and we all were just so hyped—just going crazy and everybody’s just loose.
175,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Kieran Woolley</h3>","Yeah, that was really fun. It was like a party at that triple set."," Yeah, when he landed it everybody just started partying."
176,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",Are we saying your name right? Is It pronounced Jayb?," Yeah, Jayb. Perfect."
177,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",Where does that name come from?," Dude, honestly I have no clue."
178,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",It’s never come up?," Yeah, I literally don’t know."
179,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","When the kids are stoked to meet you in the streets, how do they say it?", Jay-eeb. And then I’ve gotten Hi-yeb where they silence the J because of different cultures.
180,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",’Cause of your Latino heritage?," Yeah, exactly."
181,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",On this trip you got recognized by the waiter in Applebee’s. What’s the craziest place you’ve been recognized so far?," Probably Applebee’s, dude. Zach is the man! But I guess just like restaurants and stuff, nothing too crazy. Never like police or anything."
182,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",You’re kind of famous on the Internet. Why do you think this is?," I like how you started that question. I don’t think I’m that famous on the Internet. It’s like most skaters—you get a bigger following if you just post yourself skateboarding. But definitely when I was a kid I posted a lot of stuff of myself, and a lot of kids like watching other kids and so I think it’s mainly because of that. And I was just like—I really enjoyed watching social-media stuff when I was growing up and watching all the dudes skate Biebel’s park and stuff. So I was kind of like, "
183,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Fuck, I guess I’ll just post a lot of Instagram stuff ’cause that’s what the kids want to see", 
184,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",Do you have a regular guy that you make film you all the time?," Yeah, at first when I was posting all the clips at Poods park it was my friend River. He actually works at Plan B now doing their social-media stuff. But now it’s my friend Rios. He’s who I grew up with in Hawaii. He moved out and he’s been helping me out."
185,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Dude, it’s like a serious job, right?"," Well, yeah. I think brands put a lot of pressure, especially ’cause that’s kind of like what—I don’t wanna say why they found me or why they put me on is because of social media, but it is kind of a big part of it. And so it’s like they do kind of put a bit of pressure on me to do a certain amount of posts. Not really pressure, but it’s like they expect a certain amount from me because that’s what I’ve been doing my whole life."
186,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",Yeah. Do you ever just wanna be a soul skater out there just surfing the concrete?," Dude, I’m still soul skating. I mean, I used to post crazy—I posted every single day for two years straight when I was a kid. It was insane; I cannot imagine doing that. But I guess it taught me a lot about consistency and getting shit done. But yeah, I still skate for fun most of the time, though, I’d say."
187,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",Do people around the world want to know about the magical land that is Poods skatepark?," Yeah, actually they do. I mean, I was like that. "
188,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",That park looks so good, 
189,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Oh my God, I’m staying in San Diego forever", 
190,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",Did your parents move partially so you could rip?," No, not really. My dad was going through some health stuff and there was treatment out here and so he did that, and then my sister was graduating middle school and she wanted to go to a different high school than the options that were in Hawaii, around Kauai. And so, yeah, it was kind of like that type of move where my sister wanted a change, my dad needed some help and I was like, "
191,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",It’s super good for skating, 
192,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",So early on you got some attention from Jamie Thomas. Was he the first guy to reach out?," Yeah, Jamie for sure was. Jamie was definitely the first person to reach out. He just DM’d me and the shop that was sponsoring me for a long time in Hawaii and was like, "
193,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Yo, I want to send Dylan some boards", 
194,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",He flew out and won the contest.," Yeah, he won the contest."
195,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",How much of a dick was Dane Burman to you as a kid?," I’d say Dane wasn’t a huge dick. He’s really funny. He’s one of the funniest people I know. He’s definitely really creative in the way that he—I think it was mainly that when I was a kid I’d be so insecure and so scared to be around these guys and he would say something that just hit so hard. You know, it wasn’t like he was really trying to be a dick but he would say something that was like—I just felt so exposed. He would say some shit and I’d be like, "
196,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Oh my God, fuck. I’m already so insecure about that and he just hit it home", 
197,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","It’s good for the older guys to kinda give it to you straight sometimes, right?"," Yeah, for sure. And I was like a little kid who needed to be humbled."
198,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",So what is it like at the magical land of Poods? What’s it like over there?," It’s nice; it’s a good skatepark; it’s good weather year round. It’s pretty much what people imagine, when they think of Southern California, I’d say."
199,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",Is there an enforcer there? Is somebody holding it down?, Probably Dane Burman.
200,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",He is tough., I’m scared of Dane.
201,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",Who’s the king of Poods right now?, Probably Braden Hoban.
202,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Dude, he’s gnarly.", He’s so ridiculous.
203,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",What about that fool Little Toby?," Yeah, I don’t wanna call Toby the king. It’ll get him too gassed up. But yeah, Toby’s the GOAT."
204,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Damn, he’s gnarly, right?", He’s my favorite.
205,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",He can do like inverted 720s on the Mega and switch kickflip back lip the rail.," Dude, he’s gonna be one of the best."
206,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","So did you ever think like, Fuck it, man, I’m just gonna start up a YouTube channel and chill at this park? Why’d you wanna get in the streets?"," I don’t know if my goal as a kid was to go the old skate route and do it that way. But I was definitely watching all the blog dudes and all the YouTube shit growing up, so I was definitely heavily inspired by a lot of those dudes that do a lot of stuff that I guess is kinda frowned upon in the industry. But I wanted to go the main route. I think Jamie gave me a lot of guidance and kinda showed me how to do it and how it’s possible. I guess he gave me a lot of insight into what goes into being a pro skater instead of going the whole other route. But if I had stayed on the Island I might have done that whole fuckin’ YouTube skater thing."

208,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","So you can probably settle this for me, I’m too old to know. So who is it, Shrock or Kyro?", So I’m guessing Aaron Kyro probably makes more money. I don’t know.
209,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Dude, who’s the king of the ‘Tube?"," Yeah, I don’t know. They’re both killing it. But right now it’s neither of them, I don’t think."
210,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",Dammit. Who’s your guilty pleasure right now on the ’Tube? Who are you tuning into?," Gifted Hater 100 percent. It’s not guilty, though. I love Gifted Hater."
211,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","You want that skate gossip, right?"," Dude, but I’ve been nervous watching it lately. He’ll say something about me and it hurts me for some reason. He’s so smart with his roasts that I’m like—it actually hits."
212,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Yeah, it’s fun to watch until it’s you."," Exactly, yeah. I used to just watch them all carefree and then as soon as I heard my name I was like, "
213,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Ah, this is not as fun anymore", 
214,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",This ain’t funny. That guy’s not so funny., Hopefully he reviews Am Scramble and calls us the worst.
215,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",This ain’t funny. That guy’s not so funny, Hopefully he reviews Am Scramble and calls us the worst.
216,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Well, maybe. Did you have any trepidations about going on the Scramble?"," Oh, I definitely saw that first one with Foy and Ducky and those dudes and it was super gnarly. I think they set the bar so high that like all the Scrambles after that have been trying to reach that level. So there’s definitely that. All those dudes are so good. I think the main thing is I was hoping it wouldn’t be like huge shit all the time, ’cause I’m not super into huge handrails or huge gaps or whatever. So I think that was the main thing—like, "
217,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Fuck, hopefully it’s not a bunch of handrail dudes and I just have to figure shit out", 
218,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Yeah, what’d you think of Boston?"," Dude, I love Boston. I just saw Tim; he was in Lisbon and I saw him at a spot randomly. But he’s like the GOAT out there. He has so many spots. I’m gonna go back."
219,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","You made some new friends on this trip. I mean, everybody got along but who’d you really hit it off with?"," Dude, Max and Noah. I love those kids. They almost came out here."
220,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",No way.," It was so sick, though. They were talking about—Max was in Korea and said he was almost gonna come out. But yeah, Max and Noah, they’re fuckin’ so sick. It’s just cool to have kids that are the same age as you that understand your humor. I go on a lot of trips with dudes older than me and I feel like I can’t make the same jokes I make around my friends at home. It’s like on that trip I felt like I could fully just let loose."
221,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","How about those Australians? Man, they were skating everything that wasn’t tied down."," Oh my God. Dude, yeah, Kieran, Rob Pace—those dudes are so gnarly. Rob Race was half the reason I was scared to go on the trip. I was like, "
222,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Dude, fuck, we’re going to Rob Pace spots? It’s gonna be fucked up", 
223,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",How many kinks you got?, Zero kinks.
224,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",What about Nick Matthews? I was scared of him. Were you scared?," I wasn’t scared. I guess I’m intimidated by that dude. Not ’cause of his face, but because of his skating. Dude, he’s like one of my favorite skaters. When I heard he was going on the trip I was like, "
225,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Oh, what?", 
226,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","No, he’s fucked. He’s so good.", The first day he got seven tricks.
227,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",What was a trick that really stood out to you on the trip? Max’s pole jam of death?," That’s definitely a highlight. Yeah, I can not believe that one."
228,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",We had Rob Pace ollieing into the triple bank. We had him grinding the snake bar. ," The one that I keep talking about, ’cause I keep trying to explain how talented Nick Matthews is, is that out-ledge we went to that first day. He did like three tricks on it and he does switch back 180 nosegrind and he also ollied over the rail to crooked grind. That was fucked. Each one of those were super fucked singles and he’s just all mellow."
229,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",Just cruised it. So the Scramble—it’s been a springboard for people to turn pro eventually. Is that a goal of yours? Do you wanna go pro someday?," Well, yeah, for sure. As a kid I was always like, "
230,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Fuck, that would be the dream job", 
231,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Yeah, if you want it, you want it. What’s your biggest takeaway from this experience of getting to go on a trip with a bunch of strangers? What are you gonna remember? What hit the hardest from his experience?"," I think just being able to appreciate how dope it is to go on a trip with people that you don’t usually skate with and people that don’t ride for the same brand as you. For some reason that felt so freeing to be able to skate with people that you otherwise would probably never go on a trip with. Also, just seeing so many different types of skating. A lot of times if you’re on a brand the dudes skate—not completely similar, but they skate similar spots and there’s a similar vibe, I guess. But on this trip everyone kinda had their own steez and way that they do everything. And there’s different cultures as well."
232,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",What about your big frontside flip? Did you think that was gonna happen?," Dude, not at all. We went there and it was like—I saw a photo of it. We were trying to find something to frontside flip that whole trip. That whole time it was kinda like, "
233,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",What are you gonna frontside flip?, 
234,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Ah, I don’t know", 
235,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",That would be a good one, 
236,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Ah, this run up is kinda short", 
237,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",This is probably not gonna happen, 
238,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","You know, I’ve seen this happen before. You’re gonna land it", 
239,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Oh yeah. Right, dude, I’m fuckin’ dust", 
240,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Yep, that was it. I was like, Trust me. I’ve seen this before."," Yeah, "
241,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",Trust me. I’ve seen this before," Yeah, "
242,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",I’ve seen this happen, 
243,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","I bet you have, but it’s not me", 
244,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",Wheelbite and die six times in a row and then just magically make one., That was so crazy.
245,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",Who do you want to see on the cover of this Am Scramble issue? ’Cause somebody’s getting the cover.," Max. Dude, I want that to be the cover so bad. Just "
246,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",’, 
247,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Alright, anything else you wanna talk about? "," Shout out Zach from Applebee’s, shout out Jordan, the GOAT. Yeah, I think that’s about it. Thanks, Burnett."
248,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>","Yeah, man. You’re really easy to interview.", You think so?
249,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",Yeah!," Dude, I’m walking in circles. I did so many spins."
250,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Dylan Jaeb</h3>",That’s how it goes. That’s what it’s like. Why’d you quit Zero?," I just felt like there were other options out there and I kinda just didn’t—I wasn’t even really skating with those dudes too much. It was kind of like me and Jamie were talking a lot but I wasn’t out skating with Dane or any of those dudes. So I feel like they always knew that it wasn’t gonna be a thing. But I don’t know, Jamie’s the best. I still talk to him all the time."
251,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",So we did this trip in August and I’m talking to you now in November. And in the last few weeks it seems like things have been going pretty crazy for you as far as stuff coming out. Did you have a sense that this was on the horizon?,"Not really. I don’t know, like the edit that just came out, the "
252,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","So now you get to be the neck-high-backside-Smith guy for a while, right?","Shit, I don’t know. I battled that one."
253,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Yeah, what’s the story behind that? ‘Cause that looks really, really tall.","Thanks. Yeah, that was like multiple trips going back there and it just felt fried. Like the last day that I was there, I don’t think I could have tried it again. And it worked out—like I blacked out and just landed the trick. I was so hyped. But it was, seriously—it felt insane how many times I’d been there. And I’d even tried it before that trip, just like fucking around being at the Island skating. That’s kinda where I had the idea from. And then it just turned into a whole ordeal once I started to try to film it. I felt like I had to get it."
254,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","When you’re standing next to it, how high is it?","If I’m not on the curb it’s probably shoulder high. The hardest part about it, too, was there’s no angle for it. It’s only a board’s width, so that was the hard part for me."
255,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Yeah, what’s the secret to getting your back truck five feet off the ground?","I don’t know, I feel like I just pretend like I’m jumping. I’m just jumping and getting my back foot on it. It feels safer than front 50s for me, or something like that."
256,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",Is there a trick to it?,"Yeah, maybe it’s just like a tweaked ollie? I don’t know."
257,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",, 
258,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","It’s fuckin’ nuts! So then you had a homie clip in the Johnny Wilson Chicago video, that was pretty sick. I know any time Supreme shows up in a town it kind of brings some heat. Do you think Chicago could become a big skate destination? Not that it isn’t, but even more so?","Oh yeah, for sure. I think it’ll definitely bring more attention to it. For whatever reason people kind of looked over Chicago. I think people will realize that it’s a pretty sick city with a core skate scene and they also have one of the best shops, "
259,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",Uprise, 
260,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",Maybe attract some different eyeballs that wouldn’t have thought about it.,"Yeah, definitely. So that’s cool, and those dudes being in town is super cool. They’re all super rad."
261,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",I got to come out and skate with you and your brother in Chicago for a long weekend and it was some real street skating. We didn’t drive from spot to spot—we parked the car and pushed around for nine hours! Is that how you and your brother typically do it? Do you just drive to the zone and then you’re just pushing around?,"Yeah, there’s a lot of days that are like that. I feel like most days we just park on this street, Lasalle, where they have free parking on the weekends and we’ll just push from spot to spot. And I feel like most of the super-good spots in the city are like in that Loop area, like in the downtown area. And then the weekdays we’ll kind of drive to spots because the Loop isn’t really as skateable. So we’ll hit the one-off spots. But yeah, definitely weekends we mostly will skate all day around the city."
262,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","It’s funny, I was telling people like, It’s not only street skating, like half the spots Nick wanted to skate were like jumping over a street.","Yeah, literally. That’s funny. I feel like we skated some hectic spots that were definitely fucked up. We had to wait for traffic for most of the spots we skated."
263,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","It’s not only street skating, like half the spots Nick wanted to skate were like jumping over a street.","Yeah, literally. That’s funny. I feel like we skated some hectic spots that were definitely fucked up. We had to wait for traffic for most of the spots we skated."
264,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","That’s good, though. We weren’t waiting in the car, we were just waiting for cars to be gone the whole time.","Yeah, seriously."
265,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",in,"Yeah, seriously."
266,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",, 
267,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",Who were some of the legendary skaters when you were coming up? Who were the legendary Chicago guys?,"Damn, there’s a lot. I’d say Dave Ruta definitely was a big skater. And a lot of Uprise guys that run that shop. And then also from the Chicago suburbs there’s "
268,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Hell yeah. So again, not to gossip, but you were riding Antihero boards on the trip. Is it safe to assume you’re a prospect?","Yeah. I mean, I’m actually on the Antihero trip right now."
269,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",How will we know if you’re on the team or not?,I don’t know. I guess we’ll see how this trip goes.
270,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","They’re a tough crew, man. You got any tattoos?","Nah, I should probably get some, though."
271,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Dude, this might be the time. What’s been your sponsorship history so far? What was the first box you ever got?","The first box I got was super young but it wasn’t a really serious sponsorship, I guess. I got boards from Chocolate. It was not really legit, though."
272,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Dude, that’ll freak a kid out.",And then I kinda got boards from Krooked and then I did the Quasi thing and now Antihero.
273,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",Is there a reason why you kept shopping?,"I don’t know, I guess—well, Quasi was probably the one that I was taking the most seriously. I don’t even know. That’s when it was like, "
274,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Oh, I could be an am or pro skater ", 
275,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Right. So only recently you considered it, that you could go all the way?","Yeah, definitely. I feel like within the past couple of few years that’s when people were putting it in my ear. I guess maybe I never thought of myself as a sponsored or pro skater. I was just gonna be a guy who got boards here and there."
276,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",So did you have any reservations about coming on the Scramble trip?,"I just knew it was gonna be a lot of skating—just from the videos, there’s just so much footage from there, so much footy."
277,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",What about jumping in the van with people you don’t know or barely know?,"Yeah, I really didn’t have any expectations ’cause I didn’t know who was going on it."
278,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Oh yeah, I try not to tell people who’s on the trip so they don’t make the decision based off that. ","Yeah. I knew Brian Reid, so I was like, "
279,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Yeah, but how did it work out?","It was cool. Everyone was super chill and nice. I definitely became friends with some of the guys, for sure. Everyone was super good at skating and gnarly and cool, so it worked out."
280,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",For sure. Did you know anything about Dylan Jaeb before the trip?,I just knew him through his footage and stuff and knew how fuckin’ good he was at skating. That’s pretty much all I knew. I feel like I knew everyone’s skating from videos.
281,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",Right. So do you watch every video?,"I watch a lot of shit, for sure. I don’t think it’s possible to watch every single skate video, but I definitely knew most of the people on the trip."
282,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",Have you ever been on a trip with dudes like those Australians we had?,"Shit, no I haven’t. It was actually super entertaining to watch how gnarly they were and how easy it was for them to grind the biggest rails. It was pretty inspiring. I definitely couldn’t skate like that. It was definitely interesting to see."
283,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","What about the Frenchies? They’re on the new shit, like always pole jamming everything. ","It was sick, dude. That was also inspiring. ’Cause they were super creative, especially Max. He would just find random objects and try to make something out of a sign, or like stick it into a rail and make a pole jam out of it. That was pretty cool to see. I’ve never really been around anyone that was trying to make shit like that either."
284,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",Daewon sometimes does stuff like that. I got to meet your brother Blake when I was in Chicago and you guys are like a dynamic duo. I didn’t realize how serious he was about filming and that he gets jobs and goes on trips with companies and stuff. What are the pros and cons of filming with your brother?,"Yeah, it’s super sick skating with him. He’s really good at filming. He’ll do stuff and go on trips and shit, so he knows what he’s doing. It’s cool; he has a good vision, too, for spots and a similar vision to what I want to skate. So when I’m filming with him it’s a lot easier than other people. We kinda know what we’re both into, so it works."
285,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","I felt like a fly on the wall a little bit, just ’cause you guys had the rhythm and you didn’t even have to talk that much and it was like you were so focused. Do you ever need a hype man? Can he snap into Beagle mode and fire it up if he has to?","I have some homies that are hype men. But I don’t know, it definitely takes some willpower in Chicago sometimes because there aren’t that many dudes who are skating spots and filming every day. Not that they’re not taking it seriously, but it’s not like LA or New York where people are trying to film constantly. It takes willpower to do it on your own because no one’s out there with you most of the time. I feel like when I go to SF or New York or LA you see other groups of skaters that are super into it and down to film. In Chicago it definitely is harder. You have to make it happen sometimes."
286,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",So he’s the big brother? Do you guys ever fight?,"Yeah. I mean, we did when we were younger, just about stupid shit. But not really. It’s always pretty chill. We’ve always been super good friends."
287,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Yeah, I could tell. Almost shockingly so. I was like, I wonder if these guys ever annoy the shit out of each other?","Maybe when we were younger, but now I feel like as we’ve matured we definitely feel lucky that we have each other. I definitely know it’s rare."
288,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>", I wonder if these guys ever annoy the shit out of each other?,"Maybe when we were younger, but now I feel like as we’ve matured we definitely feel lucky that we have each other. I definitely know it’s rare."
289,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",Why do you think you guys get along so well? Is that just how your family is?,"Yeah, I would say my mom and dad were always supportive of whatever we did. Especially my mom, she would always drive us to skateparks together. I feel like just being together so much we just ended up being obviously super close from that. We just ended up skating together, too, ’cause we both love skating. So it worked out that way."
290,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","We talked about this a little bit on the trip, but you’re kind of a mellow dude. Would you say you’re shy? ","Yeah, definitely. Especially in groups. I’m definitely introverted."
291,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",, 
292,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","But then at the same time, when you’re skating sometimes you look mean. Has there ever been any misunderstandings where somebody thinks you’re mean mugging them?","Yeah, it’s funny, that always gets brought up. People always think I’m mean. I don’t know, I guess I have a serious look. But, nah, I don’t know. That gets brought up a lot; that’s always the thing people talk about is my face. Like, Damn, is my face that weird?"
293,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","It’s not that weird, you just look very serious.","Yeah. I think I’m just focusing on not eating shit. Like, that’s my main objective when I’m skating. It’s fun to me—it’s just if I’m trying a trick I’m filming I’m usually just like, Don’t eat shit"
294,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Yeah, I was gonna ask, how did that back Smith at Roxbury banks go?","Oh yeah, I was not feeling that spot at all when we first got there. I was hyped on it, how it looks and everything and I wanted to skate it, but when we got there I’m like, "
295,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",You look very serious in the photo. ,"Yeah, I just wanted to land it before the soreness kicked in, too."
296,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",You said today you got to skate some pools with Grant Taylor in LA. What was that like?,"He’s so insane to watch. I was in awe watching him skate. All those dudes are so good at it. I felt intimidated. When I first got there, I rolled around for a second and then those dudes started skating and I had to sit down. I was like, "
297,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",He’s bananas. What were the tricks on the trip that really stuck with you? ,Probably the back Smith and the switch back 180 nosegrind on the out ledge. Those were the ones I was most hyped on—especially the switch back 180 nosegrind because I had been wanting to do that on an out ledge for a while. I just learned it and I didn’t know if I could do it and then it just worked.
298,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",That was one where I had to figure out if you were skating switch or not. ,"Yeah, it felt good skating and that just worked out. I feel like most days I would be scared to try it, but I was feeling it that day."
299,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","It seemed like Boston was your kinda town, too.","Oh yeah, it was so sick. I was so hyped that the trip was there. It was a cool city and Tim was super cool and knew good spots. It’s just like a core skate city."
300,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",I’d have felt bad if I had to take you to Phoenix.,"Yeah, I feel like that woulda been hard, for sure."
301,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Goddamn it, I gotta take Nick to Phoenix.","Yeah, once you told me it was Boston that was definitely a relief. ’Cause I was like, "
302,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Goddamn it, I gotta take Nick to Phoenix.","Yeah, once you told me it was Boston that was definitely a relief. ’Cause I was like, "
303,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",What’d you make of Max’s pole jam to triple-set grind?,"That was so insane. I thought he was insane before he even started trying that. Then he got super close and, I don’t know—I was scared watching it, too, ’cause there’s barely any landing. He was flying into that wall."
304,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",Into a hole.,"But when he did it—it was so insane! It looked like a rollercoaster ride, a sketchy-ass roller coaster ride."
305,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",Were there other people’s tricks that you tripped out on?,"Yeah, there were a lot. I feel like everyone had a gnarly trick—like Dylan did that super gnarly frontside flip and then Noah did that ride-on grind. Then there was the kinked rail."
306,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",I could tell you guys were tripping on the Rob Pace kinked rail.,"Yeah, that kinked rail was insane."
307,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",With metal stairs. Just the worst fuckin’ shit.,"He did it so easy, too. I was like, "

309,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",Does your girlfriend ever stress out about you skating all the time?,"Oh no, she’s super cool about it. She’s super supportive of it. She gets that I have to skate on the weekends. She’s a creative person, too. She does graphic design, so she doesn’t have a conventional job either. And I think her brother skated, so she gets it. She doesn’t skate herself, but she’s down for it."
310,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","That’s nice. So we’ve talked about this before, but I think in this issue it would be really cool to talk about again—what did your mom say when she found out she had a photo in Thrasher?",I think I noticed it first. I remember being bummed that she got into

312,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","It was an Anatomy photo I took a long time ago at a demo and it’s a kid about to ollie a stack of boards and then there’s all the arrows pointing to everything. I can’t remember, what was your mom saying? What does the arrow say?","She has a speech bubble and I think it says like, "
313,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",This kid’s gonna bust his ass, 
314,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Damn, my mom’s cooler than I am.", 
315,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","What did she think about it, though?","She thought it was funny. She was like, "
316,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Oh, that’s cool! ", 
317,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",It sounds like you’ve got a lot of stuff kind of happening at once these days. Can you see yourself becoming a pro skater some day?,"Yeah, I’m definitely down. I love skating and I’m gonna do it regardless as long as I can, so I might as well try to make it a career if I can, you know? If that’s an option, I’m definitely trying to do that."
318,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","At 27, you’ve been skating and filming a long time. Do you feel like you have more wisdom going into the sponsorship game at this age than if someone had offered to turn you pro at 17?","Oh yeah, for sure. I feel like I’m glad that I didn’t have whatever spotlight then that I have now. I’m glad it’s happening now rather than when I was younger. ’Cause I feel like I would probably do more cringe shit, you know?"
319,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",What would the 17-year-old pro Nick Matthews been looking like?,I don’t know. I don’t even want to think about that. It probably wouldn’t be good.
320,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",Who do you think’s gonna go pro first from this trip?,"Probably Brian. I would think Brian just ’cause he just had that part that came out that was super good. Yeah, I would say him."
321,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",That’s a pretty safe bet.,He’s been killing it for a while.
322,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Yeah, he’s about your age, too. I feel like now’s a different time. It’s not like when everybody wanted Spanky and Herman when they were little kids. ","Yeah, it seems different now. Just with the Internet I feel like people are more open to different avenues. I feel like there’s room for everyone nowadays. "
323,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",Yeah. I think people can find their audience. Once you realize all the different things going on it broadens your idea of what’s good.,"Oh yeah, definitely. And then also with older guys pushing the envelope, guys like AVE and Guy, people that are still ripping. And like Julien, too, is ripping super hard on this trip. He’s skating every day and looks amazing on a skateboard. Like, "
324,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","I agree. Oh yeah, what’s the highest thing you ever ollied over?","Shit, I’m trying to think. I feel like maybe the trash cans at the Chase building. I’ve ollied those from flat and they’re pretty tall. And wide too. "
325,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Forty years on in skate history, and the question is still, How high can you ollie?",Yeah.
326,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",How high can you ollie?,Yeah.
327,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>",Who’s in your top three of favorite skaters?,"I would say BA, Pappalardo—it always changes, so it’s hard. I really like Van Wastel too."
328,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Nick Matthews</h3>","Yeah, he’s sick. He was really funny, too. In 20 years what are you gonna remember about this trip?",There was so much that happened. The last night was pretty funny with Noah falling in the water. Meeting everyone and just seeing the super gnarly skating and everyone being super cool. There was so much cool shit.

331,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",How old are you?,I’m 27. My birthday was yesterday.
332,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",Happy birthday! Why do people call you Stewie?,"It’s my nickname, like Stewie from "
333,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",How many languages can you speak?,"Four: Bulgarian, Italian, English and Spanish."
334,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>","That’s amazing. Every time I meet people outside the US, I feel so stupid. What videos did you grow up on?",I started skating in 2009. I watched 
335,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",Fully Flared, 
336,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",There’s a lot of good Barcelona footage in Fully Flared. What made you want to move from Italy to Spain?,"Basically just because Barcelona is amazing to skate. In Italy, living in a small town near Rome, there were no spots. I went on holiday for two weeks with my homie to Barcelona and then we just decided to move here. We moved the week after we got back to Italy. It happened super fast."

In Italy, living in a small town near Rome, there were no spots. I went on holiday for two weeks with my homie to Barcelona and then we just decided to move here. We moved the week after we got back to Italy. It happened super fast."
338,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",How long did it take you to make friends and get in the scene?,"I already had friends from Italy when I moved to Barci, so that helped. I skated with my Italian friends a lot, at the beginning."
339,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",Was it intimidating the first time you rolled up to Macba?,"Yeah, at the beginning it was little bit, because skating in Italy, you just skate with four or five homies. Then moving to Barcelona and going to Macba, there are 40 people watching you. And everyone is super good, going really fast. They’re skating the ledge and everything. But the people respect you, so it’s fun. I like to skate with a lot of people now. I just skated Macba a lot because I lived ten seconds away. It was like my garden."
340,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",That’s an amazing location for an apartment.,"It’s good for skating, but it’s pretty noisy, so it’s not so good for sleeping."
341,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>","Yeah, that might get in the way of other stuff you do. You make art, too, right?","Yeah, I like to paint in my free time. It’s like I have to express myself or I’ll explode. I’m scared of free time. I like to be busy all the time. If I’m not skating or working, I like to be painting. I’m never bored."
342,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",What do you do for work?,"Like a lot of people in Barcelona, I work in customer service. I work for a scooter sharing company and I’m in customer service because I can speak Italian, Spanish and English. So if someone has a problem, they ask the company and I sign on to the chat in the app. I work late—from 11 at night until 5 AM."
343,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",Damn! You gotta get some sleep after this interview.,I’ll go to bed at 5 AM when I finish working and I’ll wake up around 2 PM.
344,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>","When you got into skating, were there other skaters that inspired you?","Yeah, of course. It was just my homies in the beginning, and they helped me find a small board. My first board was an eight, which was super big for me. And then my homie gave me a small one—a seven-point-five, and eventually a seven-point-two-five. All my homies supported me from the beginning and they helped me learn and have fun."
345,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",So you weren’t really motivated as much by seeing like Pancho Moler or Jason Acuña—it was more from your friends?,"I started skating with my friends, and it wasn’t until years later that I saw Pancho. They showed me his tricks and I thought it was cool to see some things were possible, but I was already doing it. I was already having fun with my homies and not thinking about, "
346,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>","Oh, he can do this so maybe I will try it, too", 
347,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",That’s sick. What size is your board now?,It’s still a seven-point-two-five. I’m not sure how long it is. I think 28 or 29 inches—but 32 is too much.
348,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",Where did you get your first small boards?,"My first board was from my local skateshop, but then they ordered one from a distributor for me—a seven-point-two-five Antihero. That was the first small board that I learned everything on. I learned how to kickflip, shove it, 50-50 and I started to enjoy skating more. I thought, "
349,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>","Okay, with this I can kickflip, so I can do anything.", 
350,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",What size shoe do you wear?,"My size in Europe is 32, and in the US it’s a size one."
351,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",How do you get shoes?,"Danny Wainwright used to help me find shoes, sending me boxes. And then when those ran out, I bought some Dunks that Max Geronzi saw me wear. He showed my stuff to Colin at Nike and then I got a text from him to see if I would be down to wear some SBs. My first Dunks were not the skate shoes, just normal ones. So he sends me shoes and I love them. He asked me if I was down to film something with Enrique, and here we are eight months later. It’s great."
352,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",You have a “Forever Young” tattoo. What made you get that?,"It’s a reminder to enjoy yourself like a kid forever. Age is just something people create. I’m scared of people that say, “Oh, I’m too old to do this.” I never want to be too old to do something. It’s a message for me to remember that it’s never too late to do something."
353,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>","Well, you skate like you’re forever young. You jump off some big shit. I feel like in Barci you can be any kind of skater. What made you go toward the high-impact stuff?","I just do it. When I see a spot and I’m hyped, I don’t think about the size. If my homie jumps down the three block with a fakie ollie, why can’t I? Sometimes I’ll skate a small ledge to learn something new or hard, but I like to go fast and 50-50 a big ledge."
354,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",Awesome. Have you had any major injuries skating?,"I fell off a hubba and cut my head open, but nothing too crazy."
355,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>","You’ve got a video part in the works. You’re already sort of Instagram famous—as in, everyone I know knows who you are. Do you feel a lot of pressure to put your skating out in a legit video as opposed to just posting?","I don’t feel the pressure. I just go two or three times a week with Enrique and he understands the kind of a spots I like to skate. I’ll say, “I want to do this trick,” and he’ll show me ten spots around Catalonia, so it’s fun. A few months ago I stopped filming for the ’Gram and started saving tricks for the part and it has just been super fun."
356,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",Do you go out on solo missions or do you roll out with the squad?,"Because I wake up late, a lot of my homies are already too tired for a mission. Sometimes I go out with a big crew, though. Even when I skate alone, I don’t feel like that ‘cause I’m with Enrique."
357,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",Do people or security guards treat you different from your friends when you get kicked out?,"Yeah, but maybe it’s an advantage, because they don’t get aggressive. A guard will say, “You can’t skate here.” And I’ll ask for another try and maybe they’ll let me. Even if they say no, sometimes I go back five minutes later and they never try to grab me or anything like that. They respect me. So sometimes I get treated different, but in a positive way."
358,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",That’s kind of awesome!,"Yeah, because sometimes I go with Max Geronzi and the security will come out and be super aggressive with him, but never with me."
359,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",What is the condition that makes you shorter than most people?,"It’s called achondroplasia, also dwarfism. But to describe it in English, you just say “little person.” Maybe there’s some more technical ways to describe it medically, but I’m not going to the hospitals and asking doctors how to say stuff. And I don’t think that much about it, because I live first person in my body. In my mind, I don’t have this thing. I just think some people can do things that are maybe harder for other people, but at the end of it, I just do what I want to do."
360,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>","Yeah, that makes perfect sense.","Imagine if you’re in my body—maybe you see that the hand is a little different, but it’s just your hand. You don’t know how other people see their own hands. So I never think, "
361,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>","Okay, I can’t do this because I’m a little person", 
362,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>","I think that’s the experience every skater goes through, which is that you only know skating through your own body and with your own skateboard. It’s totally personal trying to figure out how to kickflip. I understand you have a radical coffee habit. I imagine that helps with the late nights?","Yeah, I drink a lot of coffee. I have a coffee pot—the Italian one for espresso."
363,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",How many coffees a day do you drink?,"I drink a lot of coffees and I get crazy when I drink it. I love it. I don’t know how much, for certain. I wake up and I do one from the pot, but it’s like three espressos—a triple. I drink that to wake up. Later, if I’m skating from the first spot to the second, I’ll get a normal one. But in Spain the coffee’s not as good as the Italian espresso, so I get a coffee with milk. Then at the end of the day before I start work, I get another. So maybe I have five coffees a day? But for me it feels like more because I’m 40 kilograms, so sometimes I get super energy. When I get that crazy feeling, maybe I want to jump off some big blocks."
364,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",It literally gives you a boost. Do you want to be a pro skater and travel the world and do the whole show?,Of course!
365,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",Do you travel much right now?,"It’s hard because I work, but I went to Copenhagen for a week to film and then filmed a lot on a trip to Gran Canary Islands. But I finished all my allotted days off, so I have to work a lot now. So it’s hard only being able to do two trips a year, but this time it worked out because I finished the part. Enrique is the best because he helps me find the right spot for everything."
366,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",Who makes your boards?,I make my boards.
367,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",What?!,"With my homies, I started Epoca. It started by me doing some T-shirts for my homies with some of my paintings. So I sort of started a company for them. But then I couldn’t find boards, so I decided to make those, too. Basically it’s just a way for us to get boards to skate them—not to sell, really. I skated for another company two or three years ago, but I didn’t really like their vision of skating. I didn’t feel represented by the company. I appreciated the help finding small boards. We are still friends and all good, but it was not my vision. So then I was working, saved some money and said, "
368,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>","Okay, let’s try to make some boards for me", 
369,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",What about your other gear?,"I get Ace trucks from the distribution here. I like them because they are low. I’ve tried other lows, but I like the Aces. I also get some Spitfire from the distribution."
370,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",You got almost the whole setup. We just gotta get someone makin’ small boards!,"Yeah, it’s also cool at the moment making my boards with my graphics. I made this one called “Bombhill Therapy.” It’s a guy bombing a hill and he’s not thinking about anything—like all the monsters in his mind stay behind ’cause the guy is too fast for them. I don’t know if I should do another graphic or not, because I feel like this represents me. When I feel bad I just go up to the mountain here in Barcelona, then I bomb down the hill and forget about everything. I get that adrenaline and it’s like therapy. It’s medicine for me."
371,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>","I know that feeling. When you have too much time to sit and think, it’s not good. Skating lets you live without thinking, but not in the bad way like drugs.","Yeah, exactly. Also, I never do drugs because my weight is 40 kilograms, and you don’t know how much it takes for something to go wrong. They can be more dangerous for me, so I never do them."
372,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",That’s a great position to have.,"It’s like with alcohol—my homies have one beer and they’re okay, but I start to feel it on the first one and on the second one I’m drunk. I get drunk faster than others, so it would be the same for drugs. I don’t want to try to figure out if it’s too dangerous for me."
373,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>","Yeah, fuck the drugs. The skating is better. What do you hope that people take away from your skating? Do you hope to inspire people or be an example for maybe some little people out there, or do you want your clips to stoke people out the same way a Max clip might?","A lot of people stop me on the street or at Macba and tell me that I’m an inspiration and stuff like that. All that is cool, and I like that people are inspired by my stuff, but when I wake up I never think, "
374,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>","Okay, let’s go inspire some people", 
375,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",Your purpose isn’t just to be some motivational force. You just want to be a skater.,"Yeah, and also a lot of people support me and they motivate me. Like if my homies see me struggle or they see my war, they say, “Right here, you got it.”"
376,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",That’s awesome. Where do you wanna go for your next trip? What goals are on the horizon?,"Of course, I want to see and bomb hills in San Francisco. Max says they’re really scary, so they might be too crazy, but I wanna see them. I also want to travel to other places in the world, not just the US—but the first city I would like to see is SF."
377,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Big Sets, Small Boards: The Petar Stanchev Interview</h3>",I think you would fit in great. And you would have excellent Bombhill Therapy there. Got anyone to thank?,"I’d like to thank Colin, Enrique and all my homies."
378,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",What town in New Jersey were you born in?, I was born in Perth Amboy.
379,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",And when did you get your first skateboard?, I got my first skateboard when I was about seven. I remember seeing a Toys“R”Us skateboard called the “Afterburner.” I wanted it real bad and my grandma got it for me. It had a gnarly tail guard and my trick was to go down the hill by my house and just skid forever. I didn’t even know what an ollie was or anything at the time. The kids skating in the area had real boards. I think this kid Dominick had some kind of Alva. I borrowed his board and my goal was to get an ollie over a two-by-four. I think I got it one footed and that was it—I was hooked.
380,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",And you had knee pads and a helmet ," Yeah, for sure. Full kit—knee pads, helmet, elbow pads."
381,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",and everything?," Yeah, for sure. Full kit—knee pads, helmet, elbow pads."
382,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",Did your folks help you get the knee pads and helmet? Did you have to shovel the driveway or do any chores?, My grandmother bought them for me. She used to spoil my ass.
383,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",And they were cool about letting you go skate with your friends?," Yeah. I mean, she would be skeptical ’cause I would hang out with older kids who had cars. And you know, "
384,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",Yeah. And then we end up going on tour with these younger guys. What’s your favorite city in New Jersey to skate? And how about when you were a kid?," My favorite city in New Jersey by far would be Newark ’cause it’s always had hidden gems. Growing up it would have been New Brunswick, I guess. That was the closest, coolest college town."
385,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",Were there any parks around when you were growing up?," There was the Sayreville skatepark. They had a mini ramp and a street course but it would always get fucked up. Then there was Edison skatepark, a blue mini ramp in the woods. Same thing—it would get fucked up and they would redo it like once every five years or something. Then there was Bricktown which was my local indoor joint. They had that famous contest there back in like ’93. Yeah, like Danny Way—all the fools were there."
386,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",Were there some contests you entered on the East Coast when you were younger?," There was the NSA. One year I won the Bricktown one and then went to the regionals in North Carolina. I got fourth place, then went to the finals in Georgia and got third and that’s where I met Dyrdek and kinda got pointed towards Alien. That was like ’90 or ’91."
387,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",Didn’t your mom and one of her friends used to go to Richie Sambora’s house?," My mom used to date Richie Sambora. She went to high school with him. But when I was growing up, her and my cousin would go on these crazy rock-star runs. ’Cause Bon Jovi lived the town over in Sayreville, Bruce Springsteen lived in Long Branch and they used to drive with me in the car to their houses. They’d go knock on the door of Bruce Springsteen’s house and his butler would be like, "
388,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","That’s pretty cool, though.", She had this friend Lenore who was the biggest groupie rock chick. She knew all these bands and shit.
389,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","When did you decide you wanted to move to Philly? You left school, right?"," I started going to Philly when I was about 12. I was 15 when Alien turned me pro, and I went to SF for that "

391,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",And you never really moved to California?," No. I would stay in SF for months at a time, though. But that’s about it. Or like I would go stay with Dyrdek in San Diego for a month or two."
392,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","When you did your tricks on Hubba, was Huf around?"," Yeah, Huf filmed it actually."
393,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","Oh, wow. And a bunch of East Coast guys were there, too. Was Liversedge and them out there?"," Yeah, Ben was with us that day—and Huf, Gabe Morford and Lance Dawes on a different day. I skated it twice. I had to do the switch 180 5-0 twice. ’Cause I did it with Morford—I did the switch crook and the switch 5-0—but he didn’t shoot the switch 180 5-0 so I shot it with Dawes later."
394,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","Whoa, I didn’t know that. Sick."," I had done it already, but I had to do it again."
395,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","And you skated with Mike Daher during that time period, too, yeah?"," Yeah, I met Mike at Union Square at night when I was on acid. I was so psyched to be in SF that I would skate all day with Huf and Ben and we’d go out with Gabe, and then when them dudes were over it I would go out and skate to Union Square and skate the ledges ’til nighttime just ’cause I was hyped. I took acid one night and I was down there by myself and Mike Daher was there on acid, too, and we just met. And, I don’t know, man—we bro’d down and then I ended up staying with him for a month or two at a time and we were on this acid trip where we would just take acid and skate every night. It was just so fuckin’ fun, man. It was like all fuckin’ night—acid and bombing hills and going nuts through the city. Yeah, like China Banks on acid—I carved the big bench and I tried to come back the next day and film it normal and I couldn’t do it, dude. I was like. "
396,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",You needed that Timothy Leary strength., Yeah.
397,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",Wow. And you moved to Philly soon after that?," Yeah, I moved to Philly and lived with Matt Reason and Jerry Fisher."
398,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",Sick. I was gonna ask you about Matt Reason. What was it like when you guys would skate during that era?," Dude, it was sick. We lived a couple blocks up the hill from Love so we had a little route—we would skate down to Love and by the time you got there you’re warmed up so you just start skating and then skate Love and City Hall and all them spots right there all day. And then fuckin’ just go home and smoke weed and chill. Then at night we would go to the underground spot in the subway. We knew how to open the gate so we would open it and have the whole place to ourselves. It was sick."
399,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","At Love Park when you ollie out and 50-50 that rail, that’s the trick that sticks out the most to me out of everything you’ve done. Did Dan Wolfe film that?", Yeah.
400,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","That was probably the gnarliest thing you’d done at that time, huh? That was insane, dude."," Yeah, there’s a pretty gnarly backstory behind that."
401,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","You don’t have to get into it if you don’t want to. But you probably didn’t sleep before that one, huh?"," I didn’t sleep and I was walking around in the ghetto trying to buy cocaine and some dude sold me crack. I had like eight bags of crack and I just kept smoking it and then at like 11:30 or 12 I was like, "
402,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",Underachievers, 
403,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","Obviously, we don’t want to glamorize drug use, but that was a part of your life then, right?", Yeah.
404,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",What are some of your favorite memories or stories of the Alien days?, Probably when Chris Carter and Mike Hill rented a Winnebago—it was the beginning 
405,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",Did you guys do the tour where you had your own ramps and stuff like that?," We did that, too. Carter was really into getting those things. He did it before anybody, and it was pretty cool. We had a tour where a truck followed us and they had our ramps and the dude assembled them and we did demos for like a month. It was super gnarly back in the day. And then at the end, we took the shit apart and left to the next town."
406,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",Do you remember Lennie on the tours?," Dude, yeah—he would grab the microphone and start preaching and shit. It was pretty wild."
407,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",Was Lennie in his own ride?," No, he was with us. And I would room with him because no one else wanted to. He would preach to me and try to get me to pray and shit and I actually prayed, you know? He was just trying to push that shit on you, but I would just listen to him and be cool with him."
408,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",Just try to meet him halfway., Yeah. He never really bothered me.
409,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",You told me once that you took your mom somewhere on vacation when you came into some money. Can you tell that story?," Oh yeah, dude, I took her to the Bahamas. It was when I got a bunch of money because I almost quit Alien like an idiot, but I didn’t. They offered me a bonus for staying and gave me a raise. I think it was like $2,500 plus 5K that they gave me and so I was psyched. I took my mom straight to the Bahamas and we kicked it hard for four days."
410,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",That’s when skaters finally started making some money. Were there any big shoe opportunities?," That’s the part of my career where I fucked up the most. I was on DC and Droors at the time. And Droors was paying me and DC was giving me whatever. They put me on a trial run where I had to just be on flow for six months. I was 100% going to get on; I just had to wait. I would’ve probably gotten a shoe. I would probably still be on now! But I got a DUI and I had to pay a shitload of money. Recs came along and they said, "
411,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","You ever heard of Elko, Nevada? Tell that story."," Oh my God. So, dude, me and Lou Metal were driving cross country and we just fuckin’ broke down in Colorado. We got the car running but we were instructed to not shut off the ignition until we got to Cali. We shut it off on the side of the road in Nevada at what we thought was a rest stop, but it was just a pull off like 200 miles from the next town. Yo, we woke up freezing in the car and it was snowing out. We were stranded—dead car, right? A truck finally pulls in. We run up and the guy had a cell phone so we called AAA. They come get us and tow us to this town—Elko, Nevada. Dude, it was a nightmare. We were stuck there for a week, in the middle of nowhere at a hotel waiting for a part for Lou’s car. I was gambling. I was too young but I was sneaking in and losing mad money and just smoking what weed we had left, just so fuckin’ stranded, bro; bumming. So we finally made it out of there and then years later on a fuckin’ Habitat tour we’re driving in the van and a tire blows out and where are we? Elko, Nevada! I was like, "
412,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",Let’s talk about your struggles with substance abuse. What made you finally decide to quit?," Well, this is pretty gnarly. Basically, I broke my hands really bad and I needed surgery. And what do they do when you get surgery? You get painkillers. So I was getting a fucking shitload of painkillers, loving them. They were like the greatest thing for me. I had the time and they gave me so many. I became addicted. And they were giving me Oxycontin, which is the most addictive shit. And so I lived in Brooklyn at the time, my wife left me. I moved back to Jersey to help my mom who was a heroin addict for years. And like, we tried to help her so many times. So you put someone who’s addicted to pills in the same home as a heroin addict. What happens? I ended up doing heroin with my mother because it was cheaper. And it was just an easier route. And I ran with that for a while. I held a job and just did heroin and like, didn’t really even care about skateboarding, didn’t care about anything. We’re getting high. And one morning, I woke up and I found my mother dead with a needle in her arm. And that’s when I opened my eyes. And I said, "
413,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","And even though you had a slip up, you’re really lucky to have a lot of friends around you, right? And I’m not just saying that because I’m one of your friends."," In the summertime, I got hurt. And I took a couple painkillers. And it was my friends who know me—they knew something was wrong, because they could tell. And they fucking sat me down like a fucking intervention and it was like, "
414,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","Hell yeah, Fred. Yeah, that’s awesome, dude. We’re all happy that we all have each other. And the last couple of years you’re building spots and rediscovering old spots in New Jersey and we’re skating with each other. It’s great. "," I’m still gonna skate. Maybe not go super gnarly, but I mean, you just end up getting gnarly anyway—it’s like part of the game. But yeah, I plan on skating."
415,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","Here’s another quote from Lou Metal. “Every time I have a conversation with Carter and Castrucci about Fred’s career, we always agree that he has five more years. This has been going on for about 15 years now.” So let’s hear it. What do you think the next five years are going "," I’m still gonna skate. Maybe not go super gnarly, but I mean, you just end up getting gnarly anyway—it’s like part of the game. But yeah, I plan on skating."
416,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","to look like for you, man?"," I’m still gonna skate. Maybe not go super gnarly, but I mean, you just end up getting gnarly anyway—it’s like part of the game. But yeah, I plan on skating."
417,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",What was one of the scarier things you did for this video part coming up?, By far the Green Monster was the scariest. I thought I ripped my asshole.
418,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>",Whoa! Describe your battle with the Green Monster.," You needed to bring a mattress there ’cause you run right into a brick wall and you’ll die without a mattress. And then I realized that the mattress was too small of a target so I had to bring two. And you gotta put ’em over the fence and get in there and hope that the security guard doesn’t come. But he usually would come after about 20 or 30 minutes—just as I was almost landing it he would kick us out. Then I would go back and add more concrete to the spot, Bondo the top, cut the rail. Dude, I think it ended up being 13 trips before I finally fuckin’ got one. That was the most times I ever went back to a spot. I was losing my mind there."

420,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","Yeah, putting in work and bringing mattresses that Ghost ended up sleeping on, right?"," Yeah, I would bring Ghost’s mattresses from the bedroom and then bring them back. He was getting kind of bummed towards the end. He didn’t want me to bring them anymore. I’m like, "
421,"<h3 class=""article-title"">In Crust We Trust: The Fred Gall Interview by Brian Anderson</h3>","You’ve lost a little weight the last few years, so it probably feels a lot easier to skate—and you’re skating every day."," Oh, man, I’m feeling light now. I love it. I feel young again except for my body hurts. But, dude, we go out and we just built an amazing spot that’s actually getting torn down like any day now, which is horrible. But yeah, there’s so much shit you could do with your life, man. Go out there and get it! No one’s gonna give it to you—you’ve got to go get it and just have fun. Build your own shit; make your own scene. We have so many great people here pitching in and making it happen. Anyone who picks up a shovel—there it is, dude. Life is great!"
