0,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","Hey, Aaron, how’s it going?", I can’t complain; just chillin’ with my girlfriend in New York at the moment.
1,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Can you walk right now?," Yeah, I can walk. I actually got the okay to start skating already at four months out from surgery. I’ve been beasting on the PT. I go to the gym all the time and go to PT twice a week. I’m walkin’ a lot and trying to stay active."
2,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",That’s great to hear. Let’s go back. How did you injure your knee?," I was skating with Jon Colyer and Joe Brook a lot, going back and forth to Portland to work on this interview. Jon and Joe were both going to leave on trips, but I really wanted to get one more clip and photo to finish it off. The deadline we put on ourselves was coming up and I needed to get back to New York. I remember thinking, "
3,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Were you freaking out?," I’m prescribed anxiety medication for some mental-health stuff. I started feeling a little panic coming on, so I’m like, "
4,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","First off, I just almost threw up. Second off, was this your first big injury to your knee?"," So on that one, I tore my ACL, meniscus and my MCL. I’d had other issues before from hyperflexing my knee. That was about six months before the recent one. But the first time I had adrenaline going and was still able to get the clip. It felt shitty afterwards and those results said a similar thing. It was like, "
5,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","Goddamn. This seems to be a uniquely American pro-skater problem. Like if a pro baseball player feels even a slight pinch, they see a string of specialists that go into every diagnostic possible and give them the best PT around. You just have to get the bare minimum and tough it up or walk it out. Seems like we should have the same health standards."," Yeah, with the things that I know now at 34, if I would have been as disciplined when I was 25, God only knows if I would have even had this injury. I’ve learned now that certain muscles and parts of your body, your hips, your pelvic area, your tibialis muscles—which are at the front of your shins—and all these other things all correspond within your body. If one thing is out of whack, then you’re gonna overcompensate for the other. Essentially, that’s what I did for months without realizing it. After my MCL tear, it would hurt; it would pinch a lot. And then all in that day it just gave way. I try to look at people who ride bikes or run or play soccer—not even professionally—they seem to take their body more seriously than most skateboarders do. They train, buy the bibs, the whole kit and it’s just their hobby. Even when skateboarding is your job, we don’t take the same appreciation and care for our bodies."
6,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","Yeah. It’s a hard balance, because you’re not just trying to do tricks, but you’re also selling a look and attitude about street life. If you bomb a hill and you look like you have a diaper full of hip pads, you’re gonna look insane. So you have to also consider the fashionable standards of the moment as well."," As difficult as it is, you can’t go 100-percent into something; you still have to keep the identity you have within skateboarding."
7,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",You can’t go full jock.," Yeah, but I see Stevie Williams on Instagram; he’s in his 40s and he’s fucking jacked. Or I watched this Felipe Gustavo documentary about the rehab stuff he does, and he’s one of the best skaters on the planet. Listening to him talk about training and all these other things, he doesn’t make it his personality or character, but he takes it so seriously and I was like, "
8,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",So you put in the work. You had surgery in June and you’re already cleared to start skating. How is that possible?," Well, I haven’t started skating yet, because I don’t feel confident yet and I don’t want to get overzealous. I’ve been extremely regimented with what my physical therapy has to be. In the past, I broke my ankle and I didn’t do my PT. I realized like, "
9,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",How have you maintained your mental health and your relationship with substances as you’ve had your main outlet taken away?," To be completely transparent, I’ve never stopped smoking weed. So as far as my sobriety, I try to be careful with using that word, because it’s very precious for some people. I just haven’t drank for what’s coming on six years now. I made the choice to stop drinking alcohol because of the issues I was having with my mental health. At the time, alcohol was just exasperating those things. Truth is, I’m getting older. I’m 34; I’ll be 35 by the time I’m able to skate again. So honestly, the biggest thing that upset me the most was my age when the injury happened. I had my surgery on my birthday—"
10,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",What’s your game?, I’m a 
11,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Do you watch a lot of skating in your downtime? Do you keep up with the sites?," Yeah, I have my YouTube subscriptions that I follow and things like that. This probably goes for a lot of people, but I try to watch the things that have my friends in it. At the same time I could watch Ish Cepeda skate or Robert Neal and I’m like, "
12,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Is that because you’re looking for inspiration on big terrain?," Snowboarding is relatable because it’s a board sport, but it’s so OD. They’re like switch 270 backlipping 20-flat-20 handrails. You can’t "
13,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","Yeah, they can hit things or build ramps to things that materialize fantasy in ways we can’t."," And there’s different aspects to street-level snowboarding, which I never knew. There are some dudes that use a winch, and maybe aren’t as respected as if you do it with natural speed."
14,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Is it funny to see the cultural norms reflected? Using a bungee for a us is a little passé.," Oh yeah, there’s only certain dudes that maybe get a pass using a bungee in skating."
15,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",I’ll give Sheckler a pass., That’s who I was referring to.
16,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","On that note, are boardslide yank-outs over? Are you still going to continue that fight?"," I read Cyrus’ Five Greats and he put them under tricks he’ll never do. Because I respect Cyrus’ skating so much, I was like "
17,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",You’re one of the great rail skaters of our time. Do you feel like rail skating has kind of gotten less interesting as it’s gotten more figured out?," Oh, the crosslock? People used to grind rails on your toe edge or heel edge and there wasn’t a whole lot of that crosslock. It was sketchy. But take "
18,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","Yeah, you gotta show that you might not have it figured out.", I think a good example of that is Jim Greco. In those 
19,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",not, I think a good example of that is Jim Greco. In those 
20,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","He’s had an honorable career. You’ve made your name as a video-part skater. Crafting these things slowly and intentionally is becoming more untenable. Do you look back at Static and the Polar videos as the more honorable discipline, or do you feel like it’s actually good to let things kind of be more temporal and less precious?", I’ll always view 
21,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Static, I’ll always view 
22,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","And you’ve got a new video part coming out in Paul Young’s Down By Law, which had an ad in the mag!", Yeah. I filmed most of 
23,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Down By Law, Yeah. I filmed most of 
24,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","So that’s an East Coast part, but you also have an all-Portland part. How important was it to make something all in your home state?"," I’ve actually thought about it for probably ten years. After years being dishonest with myself about filming a part, I just thought, "
25,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Set the record straight. Who’s got the crustier spots: Portland or New York?," Portland, for sure. We don’t have marble in the same way in the Northwest. The weathering is so much worse. In New York, you can Bondo a spot and it might be good. Oregon, you gotta Bondo, lacquer, rub brick and blowtorch the ground to make it dry. It’s like four steps."
26,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",What’s the best place you’ve been to skate?," I’d say Tel Aviv, but that’s gonna be controversial. Besides the unfortunate circumstances of the country and surrounding areas, it was a very fun place to skate. Greece was a really cool place to skate. Athens and Thessaloniki were really cool. And then probably Malmö, Sweden where Pontus and Polar are from. It’s cool to see all Pontus’ spots just biking around."
27,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",How has it been to see Polar go from a start-up skate company to the most important pants brand in the world?," It’s been pretty insane. Many of us on the team have been a part of it for over ten years, which sounds crazy to say. It felt cool as an American joining a European board company to make it an international company. I’m not saying it was the first, but then seeing other international brands come up like Palace, Magenta, Pass~Port, Evisen and others is cool. Seeing the growth of Polar has been awesome. It’s been an honor. Seeing Pontus’ progression in the quality of products, the type of graphics and the board shapes is really cool. We’ve been able to have our hands in certain projects; there’s board graphics that we get to have a good say on and board shapes, too. I don’t know if everyone gets to have that."
28,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",Toward the end of your career would you rather milk it and fizzle or go out on top like Kirchart?," As the great Chet Thomas once said, “I’d like to skate until I can’t walk.” I would like to skate until I’m 45 like Joey Pepper. If it gets to a point where reality sets in and being an 18-year-old 35 year old has to stop, I have no qualms with getting a job or going into a trade. I talk about HVAC all the time. I’ve had an awesome life and awesome opportunities. If I have to make my living like most Americans, it’s like, "
29,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","If someone is intimidated and wants to talk to you on a session, what should they do?"," Just come up and say something dorky. I’m just as timid or shy as anybody else, but I’m very approachable. I’m always gonna communicate with someone who reaches out. I’d love to believe I’m on the furthest end of the spectrum of what we negatively view as a cool guy. I’ve had people reach out on Instagram that have asked about mental health or not drinking and I’ve made friends with some people for years now. Some people have showed me their Polar board and I’m like, "
30,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>",What happens when we die?," Fuck, I don’t know."
31,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Aaron Herrington's ""Homeward Bound"" Interview</h3>","It’s kind of weird that if there are ghosts, there’s not that many of them. It seems like we just go away, right?"," You know, I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about that. I’m trying to live today, and if I’m worried about what’s happening after I die, I feel like I’m missing something today. I will get philosophical for a second: Let’s say heaven and hell—I think heaven and hell is a metaphor for the mindsets in which we live. It’s not an afterlife experience, it’s a living experience and you create your heaven or you create your hell. You can follow every doom-scrolling thing you see on social media and every clickbait thing online and live miserably, or you can slow it down and just be like, "

51,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Sky Brown's ""Gassed Up"" Interview</h3>",I heard you moved from your last place ’cause people found out where you lived and they were leaving weird stuff on your doorstep.,"Yeah, I was living in Oceanside. I was always walking around there and people figured out where I lived and left some stuff on my front door. It was really sweet, like letters and stuff, but it just got kinda creepy. So yeah, we moved to a pretty secret spot."
52,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Sky Brown's ""Gassed Up"" Interview</h3>",That’s good. Keep it secret. What’s the biggest freak out you’ve ever witnessed in person?,"There were a few fans that were tearing up and it felt really good, I guess, just seeing how happy they were to see me and it made me wanna do even more to inspire them. So yeah, there’s definitely been some really cool people I got to meet."
53,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Sky Brown's ""Gassed Up"" Interview</h3>",That’s cool. I had someone freak out on me before. You wanna hear the story?,Yeah.
54,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Sky Brown's ""Gassed Up"" Interview</h3>",I had someone recognize me when I was going into a truck-stop bathroom and then they followed me in there and I had to take a number two.

I haven’t had that one yet. Maybe one day…
55,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Sky Brown's ""Gassed Up"" Interview</h3>","Yeah, you gotta watch out. The rule is you gotta travel in a pack. You can’t get caught slipping solo out there.

Do you think that I could negatively affect your Olympic plans if we keep skating together?","Yeah, Mike, I don’t know—I think you’re making me a little bit crazy with this stuff. But it’s fine. A little bit of ice cream definitely makes my day."
58,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Sky Brown's ""Gassed Up"" Interview</h3>","Ice cream makes my day, too—as long as we don’t do it every day.","Yeah. Well, actually my mom’s a nutritionist so we’re pretty healthy at home, but when I go out and my mom’s not there sometimes I get a little sneaky."

102,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",What was your reaction when you saw your Thrasher cover?, I think it was like four or five in the morning and I seen my phone kind of blowing up. Then when I read it I kind of exploded out of bed and just started running around a little bit. I went to my outdoor refrigerator and got myself a beer and drunk a beer at four in the morning. Then I woke up my dad and made him drink a beer with me at four in the morning.

105,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",So you’ve been doing this for a while and kinda floating. I’ve seen your name for many years. How’d you get this momentum recently? Have you changed your shit up? What’s going on?," I think the last couple of years me and my filmer out here have just been putting all these little projects together. Nothing really for any brands, we’ve just sort of been doing our own thing. And then unexpectedly I had a couple parts come out during one year and then getting the Australian Skater of the Year was massive. I feel like all the momentum kinda came off the back end of all of that."
106,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",, 
107,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Yeah, the ASOTY."," I was going between board sponsors and trying to figure all of that stuff out—I went on a three-month US trip to do that and meet a couple of people. The Santa Cruz thing happened and then getting invited on all those trips, it all just kept flowing and kept going. It was great. "
108,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Yeah, how did you know that Santa Cruz was the right choice for you?"," Well, I think it’s great that they also have a really good understanding with the international people. They have really good support with all of that. I mean, the team’s great. When I met Pizzle and Andrew Cannon it all seemed really good. When we spoke about everything, they just seemed like they were really interested and they had a little opportunity for me so it felt like the right choice."
109,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Yeah, and then you’ve been going crazy ever since. You’ve been on all kinds of trips, right? What was your summer like?"," Yeah. Well, I went on the Am Scramble and then I went straight on the "
110,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",So were you ready to jump on the Scramble or did you have any reservations?," No, I mean, not really. I was ready, man. When I got that call and they told me about that I was fucking hyped. I was too scared to even skate at home. I was like, "
111,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","I’m just gonna wait it out, fly over and skate when I’m there", 
112,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",Who did you know on that trip before you went on it?," I knew Patrick and Kieran and that was it. I’d met Patrick previously on trips that I’d been on, so I was pretty stoked to see him there, too. That was cool. I got to see him again—I hadn’t seen him for like three or four years so it was super good to catch up with him on that trip. "
113,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Rad. Yeah, we had people from all over and all different styles of skating. We had these pure street skaters like Nick Matthews, we had little Noah and Max trying to drag pole jams everywhere. What was it like to skate watching all these different approaches?"," Oh, I loved it. That was probably the coolest part about the whole trip was seeing everyone skate so differently and to see other people’s minds work differently and see spots in different ways. So it was super sick."
114,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",It seems like you and Kieran—it was rare that you didn’t at least try something at the spot. Is that the Australia way? ," I’m not really too sure. I think I’ve always sort of done it to myself, like if I go on a trip I try to skate every one of the spots. Even if it’s something that I can’t really skate, it’s like I kinda like the challenge of just trying to do something even if it’s something that’s not so great—just trying to do as much as I can, I guess. And I guess Kieran has kind of the same mindset, too. He skates ramps and he’s at the top of hubbas being like, "
115,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Hey, man, how do I do this?", 
116,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Dude, just go for it and you’ll do it straight away", 
117,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Yep, that’s the way you do it", 
118,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Yeah, he seemed like he was definitely figuring it out as he went, right?"," Yeah, ’cause he was like, "
119,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Yeah, I didn’t really feel like we needed to take him to the bowl at all."," No, that was so sick to see that. I was really stoked for him for that. "
120,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",Who are some of the people or tricks that really surprised you on the trip?," Nick Matthews’ skating is incredible to watch. A bunch of the stuff he did on the trip was super impressive skateboarding. It just seems really powerful as well, when you watch it. "
121,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","What was your favorite trick that you got? You got a lot of tricks—you ollied into the triple-set hubba, you did the crazy snake grind. What was your favorite move that you were most satisfied with?"," God, that’s a hard one. I think probably the snake grind 50-50 just because that rail was so unique and it felt like the coolest thing to do. Those curves were so aggressive, it was super fun. When I locked in and went around it, it felt super rewarding. "
122,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",I didn’t think it was possible.," Yeah, I was hyped on that one, that’s for sure. "
123,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",What about the ollie into the hubba? I don’t know if you heard this but the last person who tried it in the ’90s broke their back.," I actually forgot about the hubba. Yeah, that thing was scary. Holy shit, that was super scary. On one of the falls I slid down on my knee and I was just looking over the edge like, "
124,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",Oh my gosh, 
125,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Oh, man, I’m so glad you didn’t tell me this before I tried it", 
126,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Dude, yeah, it’s better off not knowing some of that stuff.", Absolutely.
127,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",What’s your actual town that you’re in?," The place that I live is called Tumbi Umbi. That’s the town I live in but the area would be the Central Coast. I definitely wouldn’t say it has a large amount of skateboarding here. As a kid growing up and going skating with my friends, I would get on the train and go to Central Sydney which is about an hour and half away, so I’ve been doing that trip for many, many years. "
128,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","I was gonna say, with the mustache and the mullet and the heavy machinery, are you kind of an Australian redneck?"," Oh, man, I’m definitely not a true one, that’s for sure. There’s some heavier rednecks and mullet dudes out here that are insane. "
129,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Yeah, what are rednecks called in Central Coast Australia?", Bogans. 
130,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","Bogans, mate."," Yeah, there’s a few of them around, that’s for sure. Especially working in the industry that I work in, you see them everywhere."
131,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",They’re attracted to the power tools.," Yup, we call them tradies. You see a lot of Bogans in the tradies. "
132,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>","So the Scramble has become a springboard for a lot of guys to go pro. It sounds like you’ve got a good solid career at home, but is being a pro skater something you’ve ever considered?"," Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I guess it’s the ultimate goal for myself. If it ever happens that will be the pinnacle for me, I feel like. "
133,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Am Scramble Interview: Rob Pace</h3>",When will you know it’s time?," I’m not sure—I’m not sure if I get to make that call. I’ll just keep skating, doing what I’m doing and if that happens then I’m stoked—if not, whatever. Just keep skating."
134,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",So let’s start with this question—what’s your name?, It’s going to be shown in the video; I just changed my name recently. It’s Kien but I’m also still fine with Kane.
135,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",What got you into skateboarding?," I still remember this and it’s really fun. It was 2008 at my friend's place, and I was playing "

138,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>","I think they do that for full completes—Element bearings, Element trucks, Element board. You're probably right."," Yeah, it’s been around 13, 14 years since I started skating."
139,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Rad. So where are you from and where do you reside?," I was born in Riverside, raised in Moreno Valley, California, and right now I’m staying in LA, K-Town area."
140,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",I like that area.," Yeah, there’s lots of queer and trans skaters in LA. That’s cool. It’s a good community here."
141,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Who were you first sponsors and who are they now?," I was first sponsored by a skateshop in my area. The name is really funny now that I think about it. The name is Etaks, which is just “skate” spelled backwards. But I wasn’t sponsored as a skateboarder. I was sponsored as the filmer, because during that time I wasn’t good enough to be the skater, but I could be their filmer."
142,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",They’re giving you a double job.," Shouldn’t you sponsor someone not that good and they would get hyped to get better, you know? I was thinking, "
143,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Guess I’m not good enough. I have to work harder now, 
144,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>","If you don’t mind me asking, when did you decide to transition and what were your fears?"," I discussed being trans with Cher briefly in about 2018, but not much outside of our conversations. I did some research over the years on what I wanted for myself. I was finally able to get started on HRT on March 10th of last year. My assumptions and fears would be the negative reactions from people saying, "
145,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",How do you deal with that stress?," Therapy has helped out a lot. That’s something I can’t mention enough to people. I know it’s hard when it comes down to how much it can cost because therapists are expensive or hard to afford. But back to the question—I talked to my therapist for a while about being online in my early stages of transitioning, the stresses of it, all of the negativity surrounding being openly trans. Among other stresses I deal with, it became overwhelming. My therapist advised me that, ""You don’t have to do it if you don’t want to."" We both decided that I take an indefinite break from social media, and that’s one way I’ve been able to handle some stress. I’m thinking, "
146,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>","Okay, let me try to deal with myself right now, w", 
147,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",And keeping good people around you.," Yeah, exactly. That’s one way that I get through the day."
148,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>","Alright, let’s change gears a little bit. It’s good for people to know what you’re going through and it will help other people that read the magazine, so I’m stoked on you telling us. Thank you. The THERE video is coming out soon. Who’s part are you looking forward to?"," Um, I can’t say everyone."
149,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",You can say everyone! That’s what everybody’s answer has been., That’s too easy.
150,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Is there a specific part that you’re looking forward to seeing?," I want to see more Gabe clips, but we’ll see if that happens. I’m always stoked with anything of Gabe. When we had the "
151,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Euro THERE, 
152,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",That’s really sick., 
153,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Hell yeah.," But, I think probably—and this is a biased answer—Chandler. Me and Chandler were roommates. But he’s someone who is really close to me. Yeah, I guess out of all the parts, I haven’t seen no footage of Chandler. I’ve seen other people’s, which I didn’t want to spoil it for myself, but it was hard not to watch some clips. None of Chandler’s was uploaded, so I’m very curious as to what Chandler has. I think that’s the part I’m most excited for."
154,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Are you stoked on your part?," Actually, I’m pretty stoked. It’s one of the very few parts that I’ve had where I actually had time to do what I want. The first board company that I rode for—Epiphany skateboards—had a video that came out in 2015. They were already filming for about a year. I came in later on only had three months to film. I know there’s one thing that people are probably going to be bummed about that they see in my part that’s going to be a split decision, we’ll see—I’m wearing a mask in my part."
155,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Oh! I can’t wait.," Yeah, I’m wearing a mask because we started filming in the beginning of the pandemic, in the heat of it. I know it’s a personal decision currently since the majority of us are vaccinated and boosted, but for me, my family and friends, I wanted to do that to show how important it actually is to wear a mask for us. We’re still dealing with the pandemic in many ways. I haven’t seen a skate part where anybody actually has it on the entire time. I’m thinking, "
156,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",You can still do all the same things you do without it., 
157,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Yeah.," My part, it’s structured really well. I got some weird powerslide variations I’ve been wanting to do that I haven’t filmed in any edits. I’m pretty stoked."
158,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Any favorite skaters besides Chandler?," Not on the company? If we’re talking outside of the company, everyone knows who my favorite skater of all time is. No matter what debate it is with skating, I always talk about Mark Suciu."
159,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>","Oh, fuck yeah. That dude. I think he’s a robot. What do you think?", I don’t think he's a robot. A lot of his skating looks like dancing beautifully to me.
160,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>","No, wait. I don’t think I articulated that correctly. I feel like he downloads an app at night and then he just wakes up in the morning and is like, I’m gonna do that. I mean, his skating is beautiful. You know what I’m saying? I feel like with kids these days, it’s like downloading an app. You get it in like two seconds. I feel like he’s that dude."," Yeah. I asked him over the comments before, “Do you think of the trick before you go to the spot? Do you have it all preplanned, or do you just go to the spot and then think of something while you’re there?” He responded, “Yeah, usually depending on the spot” If somebody sends it to him, he’ll have it preplanned. Basically, as you said, he downloads it."
161,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",I’m gonna do that.," Yeah. I asked him over the comments before, “Do you think of the trick before you go to the spot? Do you have it all preplanned, or do you just go to the spot and then think of something while you’re there?” He responded, “Yeah, usually depending on the spot” If somebody sends it to him, he’ll have it preplanned. Basically, as you said, he downloads it."
162,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>","Yeah, for me personally when I go to the spot I gotta test it out before I think of what I’m gonna do, you know? Maybe I’m just old. But if I look at it on a video, maybe I could download it? Yeah, he’s one of my favorite skaters, too."," I kind of do that too. I have a trick list. I don’t know if I showed Jeff. I have this whole big note list that I built for months. I check off items each time I get a trick or line for my part. It’s titled ""THERE Video Part List."

164,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Why don’t you say a few of the things on the list?, No-comply 180 the red eight stair in Berkeley wearing a black dress and black veil.
165,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",I love that you have outfits that go with spots.," I’m very specific about my outfits. I think there’s a small section in my part that I’m wearing the black dress/black outfits ‘cause there’s this song from one of my mutuals, Trit95"
166,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Damn!," I attempted for three hours last time. Sometimes on the list I’ll put the trick with a placeholder, no set spot. I put hippy jump frontside 360 on any obstacle. I found a spot that we went to for that specific trick. I hippie jumped frontside 360’d through these—what the hell would you even call it? Pillars. They’re really thin."
167,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>","Let me see the footy. I won’t post it on Instagram, I promise. I just want to see it. What’s your dream trick?","Dream trick? I guess I got it really sketchy. I only did it one time ever—fakie heelflip tailslide to fakie heelflip out. That was posted on my Instagram. It was there when I had it, but now it’s gone. I could probably get that on a ledge. It took me a few hours. In my opinion, that’s the epitome of skateboarding when it comes to being good—getting technical. It’s like, "
168,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>","Oh, you got a flip in and flip out variation!", 
169,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Right., That’s all I wanted to get. Have one flip in and flip out. And I got that.
170,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Where do you see yourself in five years?," Hopefully having a bird rescue or farm, doing something with birds. I just did a Zoom meeting a week ago to volunteer at a bird rescue—International Bird Rescue in San Pedro, actually. They specialize in aquatic birds so it would be to clean up the beaches for pelicans and seagulls, clean up oil spills."
171,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>","Oh yeah, there was a big oil spill when I was out there in November—Huntington Beach area, right? Wasn’t there like a big fucking dipshit oil spill?"," Yes! International Bird Rescue is one of the biggest bird organizations that do that, so I will be the person who goes and helps with that."
172,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",I saw that on the news. That was really sad. And then I was there and saw all those poor birds that were washed up ashore with all that oil stuck to them; fucking sucked.," It’s really sad, and they usually don’t have enough volunteers. That’s something I volunteered to do and then my roommate wanted to do it as well, so we’re gonna be helping out birds."
173,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Hell yeah. What do you do besides skateboard?," I’ve been traveling with the band Eyedress. Last year we took a trip to Wisconsin for a show and I don’t want to go there again. It wasn’t a fun place. I’m sorry, Marbie! Afterwards, we went to Riot Fest in Chicago. I’ve been the hype person on stage in the band. They want me to be synth lead in the band, so I’ve been practicing synth at home frequently. I’m supposed to playing with them in April, but we’ll see after the video premiere if we’re traveling for THERE or not ‘cause Coachella is April 4th and Eyedress wants me to play on stage. We’ll see. I don’t know if I’m gonna be good at synth by that time."
174,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",That’s awesome!," What else? I model, which is something I talk about all the time. It's something that’s not that fun for me anymore, honestly. I know the majority of these big corporate companies try to do a lot of things to make them look diverse/inclusive. I’m exhausted at this point in my life, being that diversity ticket for them, but it's a survival tool right now for me—helps pay bills. "
175,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>","So that’ll be your day job, correct?"," Yes, my day job is modeling. Currently, I’m modeling for this fashion brand in Target."
176,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Oh my God. I was just talking to someone about Target., I’m gonna be on the Target billboards; y'all are gonna see me there soon.
177,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Hell yeah!," Then Urban Outfitters, I’m going to be on set with them. There are pros and cons to everything. There are things that I enjoy—I get to look cute, and that’s cool. But working with some of these companies, it’s hard especially when it comes to feeling comfortable on set with my gender and how I present myself. I literally had to have an entire discussion on set before. I had to go through several people on set—having to tell them, “Hey, I don’t feel comfortable.” They tried to put me in a whole masculine outfit. I mostly present femme; that’s what I wear. The people that hired me knew that I was trans and that I presented femme. I don’t see how it could be so hard for you to get me some clothes that I feel comfortable with. It shouldn’t be that hard. I shouldn’t have to go through so many people. That’s a negative about modeling. It’s a balance with everything—trying to figure it out and know it's not their fault, really. They’re still learning. One of the things that I know is it's gonna take some time. These companies need more trans people working on set."
178,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>","And it’s great that you’re telling us. Maybe some of them will read this. Everyone reads Thrasher. Hopefully, you get a better work environment."," Please, yes! Get more trans people on set."
179,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Thrasher," Please, yes! Get more trans people on set."
180,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",Do you think THERE is much different than other skate companies?," I don’t think a lot of us realize how much it’s actually different and how much it’s done for skateboarding in general, just starting from back when I went to Unity meetups in 2017. I felt something different at this meetup. Seeing everyone discuss comfortably about being trans or queer, it was a safe space. Fast forward to now, meetups are global. I think Unity and THERE played a pivotal role in this spark. When it comes to skate companies, you see lots of them being open with trans and queer people being a part of their company because of these meetups and being more exposed to our community. You didn’t see it as much before but now you see it. Especially after Brian Anderson came out. In general, skateboarding has been ran by cishet people, but it’s changing. THERE is needed for these changes, and that’s what sets us apart. "
181,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",You just did the THERE video. Are you planning on working on other video parts for anyone or yourself?," I chatted a bit with Alex White about a Krux part. I’m pretty lazy, so whenever I get to that. Alex has been talking to me for a long time about a part or filming videos because they’ve been doing more content for YouTube. And then whatever THERE is doing."
182,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>",What do you think of the full-length video being almost an hour versus a lot of things coming out these days that are a lot shorter. Do you think people will watch it? Do you care if people watch it?, I know people are gonna watch it ’cause there haven’t been that many queer skate videos. 
183,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Kien Caples' ""Ruining Skateboarding"" Interview by Jaime Reyes</h3>","Your video is gonna kill it, and I can’t wait to see it. Any shoutouts?"," Shoutout to Boris, that’s my pigeon. KT, who’s laying back here, that's my partner. Shoutout to all my housemates. There’s a lot of people—all of THERE, of course "

Why am I in jail?  Ah, man, for violating a three-year joint suspension. They gave me three years. The original case was, some fool at 7-11 being racist, I socked him a couple times. Spit in his face and he’s still talking shit. Walking outside, boom, boom, boom. I bought what I was going to buy and go outside. Mind you, this dude had kids with him. He put his kids in the car. I’m a little faded or whatever, so I don’t give a fuck. He keeps talking shit so I grab my board and start breaking his windows of his car. And his kids are in the car so they gave me battery, five counts of battery, vandalism and child endangerment. So you know, I violated the probation I was offered in this case. I had a three-year joint suspension, which is why I’m here now."

196,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Antwuan Dixon Interview</h3>",EE: What is a joint suspension?,"
A joint suspension is, say like you did something and then they want to give you another chance. So they give you a joint suspension, meaning if I fuck up while on probation you’re going to get that three years—no questions asked—unless you get a nice D.A. or something. They could drop it. I could have gotten it dropped but the lady wasn’t trying to show me no love."

200,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Antwuan Dixon Interview</h3>",EE: And when are you expected to get out?,"
They say, like, August the 23rd. Four or five days after my birthday. It’s crazy. I came here at 24, I’m leaving at 26. They say the 23rd, but I’ve been in this high-school-diploma program so I can get my high school diploma and you get milestone credits. And with these milestone credits you can earn six weeks, which means 42 days off. So if that goes through I should be getting out the beginning of July."

Hah! Well, we wake up. We go to breakfast. We lay back down on the bed and wait for 6 o’clock count. And then they count everybody in the cells, ’cause people go to court, then they say the count is clear. That’s when I get up, work out, take a shower, make a cup of coffee, read the newspaper that’s on the table or if it’s my day to go to class I’ll go to class. Shit, come back. Chill. Watch some TV. Then, you know, lollygag around until it’s 3 o’clock. Three o’clock count comes and that clears around 4 o’clock and then by that time dinner be coming. Maybe work out again. Chill. Do some more homework. Then 8 o’clock count comes. Sit on the thing and that clears around 9 o’clock. Then you sit around for about an hour more. Watch TV. Ten o’clock it’s over with, except Fridays and Saturdays when you have a late night and get to stay up and keep the program on."
205,"<h3 class=""article-title"">Antwuan Dixon Interview</h3>",EE: Is there anything good about being in jail?,"
What can I say? The good thing about being in jail is you have a lot of time to sit and think. Like I said, you get to think about what you’re gonna do, what you didn’t do, what needs to change and what got you here. So, that’s probably the best part about it, know what I’m saying? All the shoulda, woulda, couldas, you get that, you know what I mean? It’s a pretty good experience if you’re willing to make a change while you’re here. If you’re wanting to come up in here, boom, boom, boom—gang banging and then go back out and be doing the same shit, it’s pretty much worthless."

I’ve had a lot of time to think about exactly what I want to do when I get out. What would have happened if you would have did this? A lot of shit pops back up in your head. It’s like your brain is rejuvenating in here, especially when you’ve been out there running’ amok for awhile, you know what I’m saying? And now you come up in here and you start to remember certain things."

Man, I’m just trying to get it done. It’s healthy to occupy my time. Like I said, there ain’t really shit to do. Plus, like, I’m able to block out what’s going on around me and just zone in on what I’m doing. It’s pretty cool."

I make what you call a manwich every day. Yeah! A manwich. You get a soup and you pour some hot water in there. Not too much, so it stays intact. Throw it on the bread. Put some seasoning in there. Whatever, whatever. Put chips on it, summer sausage, you know, whatever other condiments you’ve got. Spice it up a bit."

Oh God! Some bullshit! Like beef stroganoff or some shit. Peas, carrots. You might have some peaches one day. I’d say the best thing they serve you from the chow hall is either the burritos, bean and cheese burritos or a chicken patty. Then over here at the dorm you get a hot lunch on Wednesdays so we might get a fish sandwich or some shit, like Filet-O-Fish at McDonalds? Something like that. As far as the jail food: weak!"

That doesn’t really determine who a person really is. Yeah, turn the camera on and get some crazy footage maybe of him beating up somebody and this and this and this. He ain’t drinking to have fun; he’s drinking for this. Once I start getting faded, can’t nobody tell me nothin’. That’s not really the way I am. Hopefully, this time when I get out I can show people.
